Kaya Williams,First phase of Snowmass Town Park project could be subject to some ‘scope-cutting’,"Construction crews could start working on the long-awaited Snowmass Village Town Park revamp as early as this August, kicking off the first phase of work with improvements to the rodeo grounds and surrounding parking.,But based on the latest cost projections, “We need to get to a project we can afford first,” Town Manager Clint Kinney said Monday during a Town Council work session.,Snowmass Village has budgeted just north of $3.7 million for “planning, design and the implementation of the Town Park improvements” this year, according to the town’s ,.,A “,” cost estimate for the first phase of the project prepared by MW Golden Constructors rings in nearly $1 million more than that. The proposal, which is based on civil and landscape drawings from February, estimated that construction costs would ring in around $4.8 million, including a 7% contingency of about $338,000 and a margin/fee of around $328,000.,“Obviously, this is over budget, and there (are) locations that we can find some value engineering suggestions,” said Adam Alexander, a chief estimator and corporate secretary at MW Golden.,Rising construction costs are a culprit, according to Connect One Design’s Sara Tie, who has been part of the Town Park design team.,“As Adam gets more advanced in the cost estimating, we are understanding the impacts more and more of the increased cost of construction over the last 18 months,” Tie said.,The cost of earthwork and rodeo arena surfacing, at nearly $1.09 million, is “by far the largest number” on the cost breakdown, Alexander said. The second-priciest line item is the cost of grandstands and bleachers at the arena, which are projected to cost a little less than $455,000.,There are a few ways that planners could bring down the total cost for the town, according to Alexander and Tie.,Part of that is the ‘’value engineering” that Alexander mentioned. That process, according to Tie, means “you’re achieving the same goal, you know, but in a more efficient way.”,But part of the process could also involve narrowing the scope of Phase 1, which “kicks the can down the road” on some components that initially were part of the plan for this phase.,“We’re scope-cutting now to achieve (reductions) because we’re working with such big numbers that we need to get down,” Tie said.,Eliminating some work on play fields near the rodeo arena could trim around $200,000 to $250,000 that was allocated for sodding and some irrigation for those fields, Alexander said. A decorative fence outside the rodeo grounds that rings in at $250,000 is something that the design team could “evaluate,” Tie said.,Numbers are subject to change as designers work on the 60% complete drawings (the current numbers are based on 30% complete drawings, according to Tie). In about six weeks, Alexander will “deliver another cost estimate with less room in it, which will give us a better sense of really how we’re doing,” Tie said.,There may still be a need for some “scope alteration choices” at that point, she said.,Also, the town may be able to offset the cost of bleachers, because the Snowmass Western Heritage Association that produces the rodeo “has pledged $100,000-$150,000 to assist in the purchase of the bleachers,” according to an, for this week’s council discussion.,“There’s options on the table to try to get as close (to) that number as we can, and there’s going to have to be some give and take to probably hit that 3.7 number,” Alexander said.,The planning commission will see land use approvals for the project around “Juneish,” and the Town Council will see them in “Julyish,” Kinney said.,According to Alexander, crews could get moving on Aug. 25 of this year (working around the Jazz-Aspen Snowmass Labor Day Experience setup) and then hit pause on Nov. 25 for the winter. They’d remobilize on April 16, 2023, and wrap up by the time the rodeo starts in June 2023. The schedule would allow the rodeo to operate for its full season this year and next year.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/first-phase-of-snowmass-town-park-project-could-be-subject-to-some-scope-cutting/,2022-05-10

Kaya Williams,Rising project costs still a thorn for Aspen School District bond efforts,"As planners adjust projects because of rising inflation, Aspen School District is plugging along on deferred campus maintenance and staff housing acquisitions funded by a $114 million bond.,But some of the projects that were mentioned in the , — like a new Cottage preschool, revamped District Theater and upgraded bus barn — have hit some snags, caught on the pesky thorn of rising project costs, according to a May 4 bond update that SitelogIQ’s Damion Spahr presented to the Aspen Board of Education. (Spahr is part of the owner representative team for the bond initiative.),The suggested “high priority” projects include staff housing, deferred maintenance and safety and security upgrades on campus, as well as some updates to furnishings and learning environments, according to Spahr’s presentation.,Those projects will move ahead this summer, with a full slate of maintenance work scheduled on campus and ongoing housing acquisition efforts. Of the $17.6 million in bond funding the district had spent by April this year, nearly $13 million was for housing acquisitions, according to the presentation. The second-highest spending category, deferred maintenance, totaled $2.9 million as of last month; extensive work in that category is on the docket this summer.,Suggested “next priority” work includes “reorganization of space” for the Cottage preschool, net-zero initiatives, performing arts and athletics upgrades and bus barn upgrades, according to Spahr’s presentation.,Superintendent David Baugh acknowledged that the district was “very fortunate” to raise what it did on the bond, but the cost of all the desired projects far exceeds the amount of money the district has to work with, he said at the meeting.,Inflation already ,of the $20 million bond windfall that was supposed to be a discretionary cushion for the district; with project costs still on the rise, the district is continuing to tighten its belt.,“Unfortunately, we’re taking a beating on inflation,” Baugh said. “What that means for all of the projects is nobody is getting as much as they want, for any of it.”,The Cottage was originally slated for a building overhaul that would also establish new district administrative offices, but high costs prompted the district to , and look at a modular classroom concept for now.,“We’re continuing to work on a Cottage solution,” Baugh said.,The District Theater also won’t be getting quite as much work as “theater aficionados” might , Baugh said. A 2005 bond campaign also floated ideas for a District Theater revamp, but that ,.,“This is the second bond offering where we promised to do something for the theater, but we’re not doing nearly as much as the theater would like us to do,” Baugh said.,The work at the theater will focus on safety, sound and lighting improvements, according to Baugh.,“We’re doing some basic stuff, but it’s certainly not our intention to do the heavy lift for the theater that many members of the community have dreamed of, and (that), you know, we’d love to see happen,” Baugh said. “It’s just not going to happen at this point.”,He said that some “concerned community members” are working on a “parallel” focused on the theater, but that work would not be within the scope of the current bond and may not manifest until 2025 or 2026.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/rising-project-costs-still-a-thorn-for-aspen-school-district-bond-efforts/,2022-05-09
John Stroud,"Interim plan for Sweetwater Lake focuses on health-safety concerns, keeping outfitter in business","U.S. Forest Service and Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials want to move fast on a short-term plan for the newly acquired Sweetwater Lake property. At the same time, local governments are requesting they move slowly when it comes to long-term planning for a new state park.,With summer fast approaching and the likelihood that the public will want to explore the newest 488 acres that became part of the White River National Forest late last year, WRNF Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams said his office is in “triage” mode in terms of how to handle visitation ahead of developing a formal management plan in conjunction with Parks and Wildlife.,“We have to figure out how to deal with that, because people are coming,” Fitzwilliams said during a joint meeting Monday afternoon between the Garfield and Eagle county commissioners in Glenwood Springs.,Sweetwater Ranch and the lake itself are located in remote northeast Garfield County, but are accessed from the Eagle County side via the Colorado River Road north of Dotsero.,The lake and the surrounding land is open to the public, same as other parts of the forest, Forest Service officials have said.,However, closures in certain areas should be anticipated, such as near an active eagle nest, and the area is generally not yet ready to handle a lot of visitors, WRNF Public Information Officer David Boyd said in a previous statement to the Post Independent.,For now, Fitzwilliams said his office is working to address several health and safety issues regarding the old lodge and restaurant buildings and some cabins that came with the land deal and which are used by a private outfitter who operates on the former ranch property.,Adrian Brink of AJ Brink Outfitters also attended the Monday meeting, asking that her business be allowed to continue to operate through this season, even as those repairs and other property assessments are being done.,“We haven’t decided to do anything yet,” Fitzwilliams said.,As things stands, though, “Right now, the lodge is not fit for human occupation,” he said, describing extensive roof leaks and mold concerns following several years’ worth of deferred maintenance.,“Anything we do with these buildings is short term, until we figure out how it fits into the master plan,” he added.,Aside from the buildings, there are some site liability concerns, such as an unprotected lake overlook that could use some safety fencing, he said.,Both sets of county commissioners asked if some leftover Eagle Valley Land Trust (EVLT) funds from the Save the Lake campaign that helped put Sweetwater Ranch in public hands could be used to help with those temporary upgrades.,Bergen Tjossem, deputy director for EVLT, also attended the meeting along with Executive Director Jessica Foulis.,Tjossem said that about $118,000 in donations that came in after the Save the Lake campaign concluded in 2020 are still designated for use in some way at Sweetwater. But the nonprofit organization’s board would need a formal proposal before it could agree to release those funds, Tjossem said.,The joint meeting also served as a forum for the Garfield County commissioners to , about plans to make Sweetwater Lake the newest state park.,“I have to be honest with you, I’m not crazy about this deal at all, and I don’t think it was handled well,” Commissioner Mike Samson said, leveling criticism primarily at Gov. Jared Polis who made the , to develop a new state park in conjunction with the Forest Service during a press conference on site at Sweetwater Lake last October.,“We were caught off guard by that,” said Samson, who in 2019 joined Commission Chairman John Martin in a 2-1 vote to support the Save the Lake campaign.,“Things changed very quickly, and very deceivingly in my mind,” Samson said, offering that what they thought was an effort to prevent massive private development at Sweetwater turned into potentially a state park, instead.,Garfield Commissioner Tom Jankovsky voted against supporting that effort over concerns about handing private property over to the public trust.,He questioned the financial transaction that , of the property to the Forest Service, which came about as a result of the EVLT campaign and eventually $8.5 million in funding from the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund.,Jankovsky requested full accounting of that transaction, and said it appears there should be some money left over between the various entities that were involved in bringing the deal to fruition.,“Looking at the numbers I have in front of me, it stinks,” Jankovsky said.,Fitzwilliams said he can provide that documentation.,“I’m very confident I can make it smell better,” he said.,Both the Garfield and Eagle county commissioners also called on the state and federal officials involved to , as they plan for a state park, and to make sure the residents who will be most impacted on both sides of the county line are included in those discussions.,“We are thrilled that Sweetwater is protected, but we have talked about our shared shock over it automatically becoming a state park,” Eagle County Commission Chairwoman Jeanne McQueeney said.,“What we wanted to ensure was that it has a future that doesn’t include private development, and that we can work with Parks and Wildlife (CPW) and the Forest Service to come up with a service plan,” she said.,The Eagle commissioners indicated they share Garfield County’s concerns that the area not be developed to the same degree as other state parks in the region, such as Sylvan Lake south of Eagle.,“It has to continue to be what the community up there wants and expected,” Commissioner Kathy Chandler-Henry said.,Garfield Commissioner John Martin emphasized that the historic structures on the site should be preserved as part of any development plans.,“There is some history there that we’d like to preserve,” Martin said, offering up efforts to restore the Mount Vernon and Monticello historical landmarks in Virginia as examples.,Martin added that he’s opposed to any increased federal land ownership in Colorado, but he’s hopeful the joint park planning by CPW and the Forest Service will both preserve and improve the Sweetwater Lake amenities.,Fitzwilliams reiterated that park development is still several years off, and would have to go through the formal National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review.,“We’re not ready for that process yet,” he said.,Several residents of the Sweetwater area also spoke at the Monday meeting calling for a slow approach and asking that their concerns about traffic and potential overdevelopment be heard.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/interim-plan-for-sweetwater-lake-focuses-on-health-safety-concerns-keeping-outfitter-in-business/,2022-05-10
None,Anderson Ranch to offer half-day ‘mini-workshops’,"Anderson Ranch Arts Center will host six “mini workshops” in July during its Recognition Week festivities, accessible half-day classes for a $150 fee each aimed at locals and providing an alternative to the pricier tuition and longer commitment of the vaunted ranch workshops on the Snowmass Village campus.,The ranch quietly opened registration for the workshops online after announcing its Summer Series events in late April.,Led by ranch faculty, each mini workshop will help students create an artwork they can take home.,Options include a class with ceramic artist Louise Deroualle teaching the technique of majolica glazing, where participants can glaze up to four ice cream bowls, and a session on pronto print making with Catherine Liu, where students will create multiples of their original print (Tuesday, July 12, 9 a.m. to noon); a photography workshop on the 19th century cyanotype process with photographer Esther Macy Nooner; one on spoon carving with woodworker Karen Cascone (Tuesday, July 12, 2-5 p.m.); and a second ceramics option with Deroualle teaching how to design and create a personalized mug and a painting workshop with Liu on indigo dyeing techniques (Wednesday, July 13, 9 a.m. to noon).,Workshops will accommodate eight to 10 participants. Registration is open at ,. The full lineup of summer workshops — back to full capacity after two years of pandemic restrictions — will fill the campus beginning the week of June 6 and run through summer. Taught by ranch faculty and world-renowned visiting artists, most workshops run five weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. generally with tuition above $1,000. Workshops for children are also available.,The mini workshops come during the ranch’s annual Recognition Week running July 11-16, which will also include a free presentation by 2022 International Artist Honoree Yinka Shonibare (July 13), the Recognition Dinner Gala (July 14) and the first-since-2019 return of the ranch’s popular Art Auction and Community Picnic (July 16).,The ranch’s annual Summer Series of artist talks opens July 7 with Tony Lewis and continues with installation artist Liz Larner (July 21), photographer Jeff Wall (July 28) and painter Maysha Mohamedi (Aug. 4).",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/anderson-ranch-to-offer-half-day-mini-workshops/,2022-05-09
None,Eagle County appoints new  service officer to help local veterans,"Eagle County has a new assistant veterans service officer: Jacqueline (Jacki) Allen-Benson, a 30-year resident of Eagle County and a U.S. Marine who served in the Vietnam War, was approved last week by the Board of County Commissioners.,In her new role, Allen-Benson will be responsible for helping connect veterans in the county to the many services and support systems that are available to them.,“I’m really anxious to help my fellow veterans,” said Allen-Benson, who will serve a two-year appointed term through ​​April 30, 2024. “Because I have that background, and I received veteran services myself, I know how challenging it can be to navigate the bureaucracy. When I saw that there was an opportunity that I maybe could help veterans get through some of that, I just jumped at the chance.”,After Allen-Benson enlisted in the Marine Corps, she was stationed in Quantico, Virginia, and worked in research and development on top secret weapons projects. She said that she found her way to the Marines through pure accident, when she saw a recruitment poster on the wall as she was in line to register for college.,Allen-Benson was the only woman on her research and development team, where she served with 14 men. She said that at the time she enlisted, she was unaware that women were allowed to join the Marine Corps. While her family’s reaction to her surprise decision was not positive at the outset, she said that her experience in the military was both challenging and gratifying.,“My dad even called my congressman, because I had attended private school and was pretty sheltered, and he just had visions of how horrible it was going to be for me. But it turned out that it was not horrible,” Allen-Benson said. “It was probably the best thing I’ve ever done in my life.”,Allen-Benson has a long history of public service in Colorado communities. She moved to the state in 1978 to pursue a degree in horticultural science under the G.I. Bill, after which she served as executive director of LIFTUP, working to provide people with equitable food security. After moving to Eagle County in 1992, Allen-Benson helped to start the Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP), which works to match volunteers ages 55 and older with local, part-time opportunities at nonprofit partner agencies and hospitals.,“I have had a really extra full life, and I love helping people, and veterans in particular,” Allen-Benson said. “When you’re in there, it’s more like a brotherhood, but when you get out, then it was rough, and I think that veterans now are finding the same thing. You’re such a close-knit family, and you have a very direct and significant purpose in your life, and then there you are — out in the world.”,In the three decades that she has lived here, Allen-Benson said she has not personally used many of the services, and that in learning the full landscape of available supports, she hopes to increase the number of veterans that are benefiting from Eagle County’s veteran services.,“I thought I knew a lot, and I knew, like, not even the tip of the iceberg,” Allen-Benson said. “So I think that there’s probably a lot of other veterans out there that could really benefit from the things that are offered through the Veterans Administration.”,Allen-Benson will be working closely with longtime Eagle County Veterans Service Officer Pat Hammon, who has been serving the veteran community for 12 years.,“I admired her for years,” Allen-Benson said. “One time I was having a problem with a medical bill that I had that I was just furious about, and I came to see Pat and she was able to help. She’s just such a wonderful person.”,To learn more about the veteran services that are available in Eagle County, contact Allen-Benson at , and 970-328-8875, or Hammon at , and 970-328-9674.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/eagle-county-appoints-new-service-officer-to-help-local-veterans/,2022-05-09
Scott Condon,RFTA eyes bus service cuts this summer due to labor shortage,"The labor shortage bug spreading among Roaring Fork Valley employers has bit the public bus agency in a big way.,The Roaring Fork Transportation Authority staff is advising the board of directors to reduce the number of daily bus trips by 72 this summer. That would be a 7% reduction from what is planned. The board will be asked to consider the proposal Thursday in a public hearing at its regular meeting in Carbondale.,“RFTA has been struggling with staffing shortages over the last 18 months as have many of the employers across the nation and within our region,” the staff memo said. “RFTA has accommodated these staffing shortages through reduced service levels during the heart of the global pandemic or by asking more of our workforce.”,The memo continued, “RFTA has been in a non-stop hiring process since the winter of 2020/2021, but has made little progress to adding to our ranks and hitting or maintaining our target of 185 fulltime CDL bus operators.”,In an interview Monday, RFTA chief executive officer Dan Blankenship said a number of factors contribute to the inability to hire workers. The lack of affordable housing is a big one.,RFTA has secured 60 to 70 units to lease on a seasonal basis in winters, in addition to the units it owns or has under extended lease, he said. In the summer, many of those 60 to 70 units are unavailable. For example, many units at the Marolt and Burlingame housing complexes are unavailable in summers.,Another big factor is the cost of living in the region. Many prospects don’t accept positions once they learn about inflated prices in the area, Blankenship said. That has also made it tough for RFTA to retain employees. Those problems persist despite what he said is a favorable pay scale.,“We’ve been doing a full-court press and trying everything we can to recruit people,” Blankenship said.,As it stands, RFTA figures it would be at 90% operational readiness for the summer. In other words, it would be 10% below the number of drivers needed to cover the scheduled service. And that’s before any absences, retirements and unexpected issues, Blankenship said.,The proposed service cuts would put the bus agency at a 105% operational readiness.,The proposed service reductions would affect everything from RFTA’s bread-and-butter Bus Rapid Transit service to Maroon Bells shuttle frequency.,The BRT service makes fewer stops throughout the region between Aspen and points downvalley. As proposed, the number of one-way, daily BRT trips would be reduced to 116 from the planned 149. That’s a reduction of 33 trips or 22%.,The frequency of Maroon Bells shuttles would be reduced from 15 minutes to 20 minutes after 1 p.m. That would reduce daily shuttles to 59 from 64, a reduction of 8%.,Some routes would not be affected, such as the free service in Aspen, Ride Glenwood Springs and the Carbondale circulator.,Ironically, the reduction in service comes at a time when the board of directors has kicked around experimenting with free fares to spur ridership. A bill that passed the state Senate and is expected to pass the state House would provide millions in grants to allow transit operators to provide free service for at least one month during the 2022 and 2023 summers, as outlined by the ,. The bill has the support of Gov. Jared Polis.,RFTA’s staff and board have enthusiastically discussed the possibilities of that legislation, but Blankenship said it probably isn’t realistic to consider offering free service — theoretically increasing demand — at a time the agency has to reduce service due to inadequate staffing levels.,The idea of free service would be to encourage long-term changes in patterns and get people to ride buses more frequently. That would be difficult, Blankenship said, if new riders had trouble getting on buses and, if they did board, being forced to stand. That wouldn’t make a good impression.,“I’m not optimistic staff would recommend doing that,” he said. There’s a better chance the agency could plan ahead for a grant for free fares during a portion of summer 2023, he said.,RFTA will look at adding more affordable housing. It owns various pieces of land that may be suitable for development.,“Based on current conditions, we need a lot more housing,” Blankenship said.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/rfta-eyes-bus-service-cuts-this-summer-due-to-labor-shortage/,2022-05-10

Rick Carroll,AVH’s directors-elect await certification of election results,"Monday’s scheduled swearing-in of three directors on the Aspen Valley Hospital board was postponed because the results of the May 3 election were awaiting certification.,The delay didn’t affect the complexion of the board, however: The three directors-elect are also incumbents.,“Board election results will be certified on Friday,” said AVH election official Andrea Shaffran during the board’s monthly meeting held over Zoom. The officers must also take their oaths in person, Shaffran said, noting that will happen at the June board meeting.,Votes still to be tallied include mail-in ballot arrivals that were postmarked in time to be counted, she said.,Re-elected to the board were Chuck Frias with 1,153 votes, Lee Schumaker with 1,108 and David Eisenstat with 991. The single challenger, Michael Buysse, had 372 votes, according to the unofficial results.,AVH board seats have three-year terms and no term limits.,Frias, Schumaker and Eisenstat round out a board that includes Drs. Melinda Nagle and Greg Balko. All five were on the board during the height of the pandemic; the recent election results signaled the community’s vote of confidence in the directors, said Eisenstat and Schumaker.,Frias also said, “I’m very glad to serve and would also like to say I believe we have a very high functioning and very experienced and balanced board, and it has done a good job supporting the executive team, which we’re lucky to have. Thanks to all the voters for their support.”,Hospital CEO David Ressler also gave props to Shaffran for her first go as the AVH election official.,“She learned what all the requirements are and executed that election process flawlessly,“ Ressler said. ”And that really took a lot of work on her part. She took the responsibility, and that rested entirely on her shoulders.“,In other AVH news:,• The first quarter of 2022 saw near across-the-board increases in patient activity at AVH, Ressler said during his CEO update to the board.,“That first quarter (in 2021) was pretty significantly impaired by the pandemic,” he said. “As we entered 2022 with our restrictions having been lifted … now we’re getting a true picture of the sort of post-COVID, the post-COVID hangover, so we’re up 18% over our COVID-impaired year last year.”,Ressler was referring to the first-quarter increase in hospital admissions over the same period during the 2021 calendar year.,Elsewhere, deliveries were up 6.7% from January through March compared to the same period last year; emergency room visits shot up 28.8%; surgeries increased 11.7%; outpatient visits fell 5.3%; the average length of stay dropped 15.1%; clinic registrations rose 24%; and primary care business saw a 12.5% boost, according to Ressler.,“That increase was really driven by our January levels of activity,” Ressler said, noting it was “probably related to omicron (the COVID-19 variant),  so we had a lot of people coming to our primary care practice for tests and vaccinations.”,• AVH will host its health fairs Nov. 10, 11 and 12 at the Aspen hospital and Nov. 13 at the El Jebel Community Center.

Ike Fredregill,Drought won’t impact Glenwood Springs drinking water supply,"Despite persistent drought conditions, Glenwood Springs water supply can easily accommodate city users’ needs and more for the foreseeable future, Public Works Director Matt Langhorst said.,While snow water equivalent, aka snowpack, feeding the basins north of Glenwood Springs is 8% below average, Langhorst said the city’s main water sources — Grizzly and No Name creeks — provide more than enough water to meet the city’s needs, even in the dry years.,“If you take how much water comes off both No Name and Grizzly creeks, we could drop down a significant amount and still be good,” Langhorst said.,The first of two primary water sources, Grizzly Creek basin’s lowest snowpack was recorded in 1977, yet the basin still produced more than 4,000 acre feet of water that year. Glenwood Springs uses about 2,200 acre feet of water annually, Langhorst said.,Before pulling from Grizzly Creek, however, the city relies on No Name Creek, but no monitors are in place to monitor snowpack feeding the source.,“Usually in June or July, No Name gets low enough that we turn on the diversion for Grizzly Creek,” Langhorst explained. “We could still live on No Name Creek past July, but we would dry the creek up. We still want water going past the intake for aquatic life and other environmental uses.”,On the high side, the Grizzly Creek basin produced more than 17,600 acre feet of water in 1986.,In addition to water rights on No Name and Grizzly creeks, Glenwood Springs has access to about 500 acre feet of water in the Ruedi Reservoir, southeast of the city, Langhorst said.,City staff also pay close attention to water availability in relation to future development.,As project proposals flow into city hall, city staff measure the impact on the surplus using an Equivalent Residential Unit (EQR) of about 350 gallons per day for a standard four-bedroom home with two bathrooms.,“When you build, let’s say 300 condo units, they are not a full EQR,” Langhorst said. “(Each unit) is something less, because most will have less than four bedrooms, and it’s doubtful the majority have two bathrooms or 3,500 feet of lawn area.”,The city then applies the relevant EQR per development against its water model to determine whether city infrastructure and water supply can meet the demand.,“We know we can meet demand, but the water model helps us illustrate that,” Langhorst said. “As we look at what (proposed developments) do to our system, and so far it’s neutral.”,Ample water supply, however, doesn’t mean water restrictions are off the table. Langhorst said the city’s watering restrictions in recent years were implemented to facilitate repairs to water plant infrastructure and accommodate for historic spikes of sediment flowing into the system as a result of debris flows.,To alleviate stress on the system and lessen the likelihood of future restrictions, the city invested about $8.5 million in water infrastructure upgrades in anticipation to and as a result of the debris flows.,Following the infrastructure upgrades, the city can treat about 8.5 million gallons a day and store up to 6 million gallons.,On the hottest days, the city typically uses up to 4.5 million gallons a day.,Glenwood Springs’ drinking water supply might not be at risk as a result of the ongoing drought, but Garfield County could still get stuck with cotton mouth.,Brendon Langenhuizen, the Colorado River District director of technical advocacy, said one of the greatest risk factors presented by a county wide drought is increased fire risk.,“Drought slows regrowth on burn scars, which can lead to debris flows like those we experienced in 2021,” Langenhuizen said. “Also the warmer temperatures cause more moisture to evaporate from our soils.”,Drier soils lead to drier vegetation, which increases wildfire risk. Additionally, drier soils absorb more precipitation and snowpack, decreasing the amount of snow melt flowing into the county’s rivers and tributaries, Langenhuizen explained.,The current Natural Resources Conservation Service drought maps show Garfield County’s status as moderate.,“Last year at this time, we were seeing the flows in the Colorado River at about 50% of average,” Langenhuizen said. “This year, we’re seeing those flows at closer to 80% of average.”,River flows can indicate how quickly snow is melting in key watersheds, and river flow averages are gauged over a 30-year timeframe.,“Conditions are looking better this year,” Langenhuizen said.,Regardless of improved river flows, it’s too soon to say whether this year’s drought will be better or worse than years prior.,The monsoon season, which typically spans from June-August, could be the determining factor, he explained.,“We rely on those monsoonal rains,” Langenhuizen said. “And the forecast is calling for hotter, drier weather in the next three months. I’d rather it be the other way around.”,Whereas the county has plenty of drinking water, recreation and agriculture could be impacted by drought conditions, he said.,Early spring drought conditions can create more opportunities for anglers. But, later in the season, waterway temperatures rise due to a lack of snowmelt entering the rivers. Warmer waters stress fish, can cause fish kill and are generally viewed as bad for the fishing environment, said Lindsay DeFrates, a River District media specialist.,Less water in the river overall reduces other river recreation activities, such as stand-up paddleboarding, rafting and kayaking, DeFrates added.,While Garfield County’s water outlook for 2022 is looking up, DeFrates said the area has a long way to go before it clears its drought status.,“Because we’ve been in drought conditions for so long, our storage capacity in our reservoirs is drastically lowered,” she said.,Langenhuizen added, “Ideally, we need three to five really wet, back-to-back years before we could really consider ourselves out of the drought.”",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/drought-wont-impact-glenwood-springs-drinking-water-supply/,2022-05-08
None,Willoughby: Mother is the greatest word in all languages,"If your memory of history lessons from elementary and high school is like mine, you likely found it overweighted with wars and presidents but short on positive cultural changes. I think you would have enjoyed the following, a history of Mother’s Day.,The idea of a day to honor mothers took root in America in 1904-05 with two important adherents, Anna Jarvis and Frank Hering. Jarvis tended to the wounded in the Civil War and became a peace activist. She teamed up with suffragette Julia Ward Howe to promote what she called Mother’s Day for Peace, mothers advocating against wars to prevent their husbands and sons from being maimed or killed. They organized to create a national holiday. Jarvis held what is credited as their first celebration, a religious event at Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church in West Virginia in 1907.,Hering is known as the Father of Mother’s Day. He began organizing in 1904 in Kansas City within the Fraternal Order of Eagles. His efforts focused on supporting mothers of war victims with his group tagged American War Mothers. At a national convention the Eagles created Mother’s Day celebrations for their members in 1912 and were influential in the push to make it a national holiday.,The first attempt to get a male-dominated Congress to create a holiday failed in 1908.The movement grew without their help with many states establishing a holiday by 1911. Congress caught up and passed it in 1914. President Woodrow Wilson signed the proclamation creating the second Sunday in May as “a national holiday to honor mothers.”,Aspen didn’t wait for the official holiday. There are notes in The Aspen Times as far back as 1908, with the Eagles and local churches celebrating. The paper advised in 1912, “Put on a white carnation and go to church for mother’s sake.”  In those early years the tradition was to wear a white carnation if your mother was not alive and a pink one if she was still alive. The Times in 1914 stated, “Mother is the greatest word in all languages and it represents the greatest personage in all the world. Let us try and appreciate HER from this time on.”,Jarvis lived long enough to see her aspiration come to fruition, but she lamented the commercialization. During World War I, 80,000 letters to mothers from soldiers abroad were delivered just to New York City. Hallmark began producing Mother’s Day cards by 1920.,The commercialization in Aspen began in 1914 with Platt’s advertising flower sales. In192, Aspen Drug began advertising “fancy boxes of candy for her.” Al Lamb’s drugstore entered the fray the next year. By the late 1920 jewel boxes, jewelry, fancy pillows and framed photos were marketed.,Not to be outdone by the Eagles, the Elks national organization established Mother’s Day rituals in 1926.  Aspen’s chapter held one that same year with “exercises that will express anew reverence for mothers” that included a carnation for each attending mother. The program expanded after that year with additional events including, as an example, former Exalted Ruler Leonard Shoemaker, the local Forest Service agent, delivering a “tribute to mothers.”,Don’t forget to honor your mother today.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/local/willoughby-mother-is-the-greatest-word-in-all-languages/,2022-05-08
Scott Miller,"Eagle County to see less summer air service; no Chicago, Atlanta directs","Airlines will cut back this summer’s flights into the Eagle County Regional Airport.,Eagle County Aviation Director David Reid said traffic in the first quarter of 2022 increased 22% over the same period in 2021. Traffic in 2021 was the highest since 2008.,But the winter flight season ended April 5. Until next ski season, the airport will see three flights per day from Denver on United Airlines and one daily American Airlines flight from Dallas. There will be two flights per day from Dallas starting in June.,That’s a decline from 2021, when American flew into Eagle County from Chicago, and Delta Airlines had a flight from Atlanta.,Reid said the increase last year was due in part to cutbacks in international flights. With international flights back on airlines’ schedules, flights were cut back elsewhere.,Reid said the flights from Chicago and Atlanta performed “relatively well.” But, he added, airlines are currently working to build back from the significant cutbacks that came with the 2020 onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.,“There’s a huge pilot shortage,” Reid said, adding that a lot of airplanes are parked right now in the desert Southwest.,Reid said airlines this year are working to rebuild capacity. But, he added, airport officials are still talking to airlines about adding routes to and from Eagle County.,Peter Dann is the chair of the EGE Air Alliance, a nonprofit group of local businesses and governments working to build service to Eagle County. When asked about how the summer flight cutbacks will affect business, Dann said, “I guess we’re going to find out.”,Dann noted that the airlines are trying to hire people. But hiring pilots takes time and, obviously, people with special skills. Dann added that airlines are also short on aircraft and other equipment.,“Every airline has orders in,” Dann said, adding that most of those orders have been delayed by continuing supply chain disruptions.,Dann noted that he and other local representatives have been talking to airlines. But, he added, airlines are going to put equipment and people into routes that carry the most paying passengers.,Dann said this summer’s flight schedule has caused alliance members to focus more on the future than the here and now. And, he added, there are conversations bubbling for potential new service in 2023 and 2024. He didn’t share details.,The cutbacks in summer service this year come as Vail has , to focus more on destination guests, people who tend to fly for their mountain vacations.,Vail Economic Development Director Mia Vlaar said roughly two-thirds of those destination guests fly to those vacations. About 20% of those passengers fly into Eagle County.,Vlaar said she doesn’t expect less summer service into the local airport to have a “significant” impact on visitation, adding that service this summer will actually mirror the service available in 2019.,Work will start this year on a project that will add another taxiway to the Eagle County airport.,Reid said the FAA is funding 90% of a $1.4 million earthwork project to the taxiway to serve the north side of the airport runway. Of the rest, 5% is coming from airport funds. The remainder is coming from a state grant. No local taxpayer funds will be used.,Reid said the project will improve access to the Colorado National Guard’s High Altitude Aviation Training Site, as well as potential growth — perhaps additional hangars — on the northwest corner of the property.,The taxiway will be constructed in four years or so, but Reid said doing the earthwork now will save “a lot of money.”,The airport is also working on an updated master plan. That $750,000 project is also funded at 90% from the feds, with a state grant adding 5%.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/eagle-county-to-see-less-summer-air-service-no-chicago-atlanta-directs/,2022-05-08
Carolyn Sackariason,Traffic counters planned for Highway 82 corridor,"Transportation officials are working to get traffic counters placed at key locations along the Highway 82 corridor, including the often-used Power Plant Road.,Power Plant is a de facto route for commuters coming into Aspen from McLain Flats via Cemetery Lane, or leaving town via residential streets in the West End neighborhood.,In the past, the city of Aspen has done traffic counts on Power Plant Road for various reasons, but there has never been direction from top government officials to make it permanent.,Until now. Aspen City Council approved a $50,000 expenditure last month to put a permanent traffic counter on Power Plant.,“It’s pretty important because a lot of decisions are made on vehicle counts,” said Pete Rice, the city’s deputy city engineer. “We are trying to get a clear picture for the public and the council and get real data.”,The only traffic counter in the upper valley is at Castle Creek Bridge, which was placed in 1999 as part of the Colorado Department of Transportation’s final environmental impact statement for the Entrance to Aspen ,.,The city uses the traffic counter to stay on track with CDOT’s established goal of 1993 traffic levels of a monthly average of 23,675 cars daily.,But with an increasing number of commuters using Power Plant and the West End to divert backups on Main Street, the counter on Castle Creek does not give the full picture of traffic levels in and out of town.,The placement of the traffic counter on Power Plant Road, as well as several other locations along Highway 82, comes at a time when the, around the history of the Entrance to Aspen and CDOT’s record of decision.,Rendered in 1998, the record of decision’s preferred alternative signed off by CDOT and the Federal Highway Administration identifies the Entrance to Aspen as a two-lane parkway that goes under the Marolt-Thomas Open Space via a cut-and-cover tunnel that has a transit component including a light rail system and ends up on Seventh and Main streets leading to Rubey Park.,When the traffic counters will be installed is a question that David Pesnichak, regional transportation administrator for the Elected Officials Transportation Committee, wishes he could answer.,The project originated from the EOTC and is funded mostly by the advisory committee comprised of the elected officials from the city of Aspen, town of Snowmass Village and Pitkin County.,Pesnichak said the EOTC has earmarked $200,000 for traffic counters at Smith Hill Way where it intersects with McLain Flats Road, as well as at Highway 82 near the airport, Brush Creek Road and Owl Creek Road, along with the city’s commitment of $50,000 for Power Plant Road.,It was part of the EOTC’s request for proposals for design and build services so that all of them could be done with one system and coordinated.,Pesnichak said the RFP issued earlier this year didn’t attract any bidders and he is preparing to amend the proposal to just include the design portion of the job.,“Our hope was to get it installed this fall,” he said, adding that now the plan is to have a design later this year and installation in the spring.,If it can be done sooner, it will, Pesnichak said.,“We haven’t closed the door,” he said. “If we are going to have a broader picture of what traffic is doing over time, we really need these counters.”, ",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/traffic-counters-planned-for-highway-82-corridor/,2022-05-07
Scott Condon,Ambitious plan for preventing development on Roaring Fork region land,"The oldest land trust in Colorado, Aspen Valley Land Trust has set an ambitious goal to double the amount of land that it has spared from development in the next decade.,The trust has purchased land or acquired conservation easements on 45,000 acres in the Roaring Fork and Lower Colorado River valleys in the past 55 years. The nonprofit organization’s new strategic plan calls for conserving another 40,000 to 50,000 acres in just the next decade.,A map of AVLT’s protected lands shows it has historically been slightly more active in the Roaring Fork Valley than in the Lower Colorado River Valley. It has conserved 24,166 acres between Aspen and Glenwood Springs and offshoot valleys. It has conserved 20,766 acres in the ranchlands and farm country surrounding New Castle, Silt, Rifle and Parachute. The balance is likely to shift over the next decade.,“There are some large parcels left in the Roaring Fork Valley, but by and large most of the opportunity is in the Colorado River Valley,” said Suzanne Stephens, the executive director of AVLT for the past six years.,It will be a hefty challenge to conserve land anywhere thanks to soaring land prices, but AVLT is undaunted. One big advantage is that Colorado has significantly sweetened the incentives. The tax credit offered by the state for conservation used to be 50 cents on the dollar. It has been boosted to 90 cents, according to Stephens.,With few exceptions, AVLT depends on voluntary agreements with landowners rather than outright purchases of property. When it acquires a conservation easement, the landowner retains ownership but limits or surrenders development potential in return for tax credits. The appeal is often that the tax credits can often be used as revenue to plow back into a farm or ranch, Stephens said.,Another challenge is some of the targeted land is also property ripe for development of affordable housing — a dire need throughout the region. AVLT is acutely aware of needs beyond preservation of open space.,“We’re not just here to commit random acts of conservation,” Stephens said in a meeting Thursday with the Pitkin County Open Space and Trails program’s board of directors.,After the meeting, she said communities could achieve preservation of open space and development of affordable housing with proper planning.,“I truly, truly don’t think it needs to adversarial,” she said.,AVLT’s target area stretches from the Continental Divide east of Aspen to the Roan Plateau west of Parachute. That area encompasses 2.1 million acres, with the vast majority held by public land management agencies. According to AVLT statistics, 42% of the area is national forest, 21% Bureau of Land Management holdings and about 1% held by Colorado Parks and Wildlife and local open space programs.,That leaves 35% as private land, but the importance of that land to wildlife and food production can’t be exaggerated.,“Generally, public land occupies the higher elevations and peaks and private land covers the lower elevations and valleys,” AVLT’s website said. “The valley bottoms and lower elevations are often the most rich and productive for both wildlife and humans; they are also the most highly threatened by growth and development pressure.”,To craft its strategic plan, AVLT engaged in an extensive public engagement process where it consulted with 550 people through open houses, surveys, interviews and meetings with municipal officials. That input will help determine what lands to pursue. The plan spells out specifically the types of qualities the organization is seeking in property is conserves.,The priorities include some of the obvious attributes:,But AVLT is also looking for opportunities that provide less obvious advantages. The organization wants to promote equity by expanding outdoor access for communities with the highest need. Stephens said conservation groups run the risk of sinking into irrelevancy when not catering to all segments of local constituents.,The organization will also gauge acquisitions by the potential to provide recreational and education for local residents.,A final factor is acquisitions that help with climate resilience.,To date, AVLT has protected 67 square miles, the equivalent of a strip 1 mile wide from Aspen to Rifle. If it successfully achieves its goal, that will double by 2032.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/ambitious-plan-for-preventing-development-on-roaring-fork-region-land/,2022-05-08

The page for fire response went out just before 3 p.m., according to Jake Andersen, the deputy chief of operations for Aspen Fire Department.,The fire was “contained” as of about 4:15 p.m. Sunday, Andersen said in a phone call, and it was “controlled” before 7:25 p.m., he wrote in a text message.,Containment means crews had established a preliminary line around the fire, but it had not yet been completely extinguished; a fire is “controlled” when it is officially out, he said in a phone call Sunday afternoon. The fire covered about 1.5 acres, he said in another phone call later that evening.,By about 5 p.m. Sunday, crews appeared to have mostly doused the fire and were still working onsite with fire apparatus. By that point, the main signs that a fire had broken out were burnt patches of ground, some charred tree trunks and the smell of smoke.,The fire was “fast moving and in the wind, and we’re lucky to get so many people on it so quick,” Andersen said.,“Officially, the cause is under investigation,” Andersen said.,Castle Creek Road is on the backside of Aspen Mountain, and the road goes about 11 miles from the roundabout to get to the Ashcroft area.,More than 15 personnel responded to the fire, including 11 personnel from the Aspen Fire Department, two from the Roaring Fork Fire Rescue Authority and two from Aspen Ambulance and folks from the Pitkin County Sheriff’s Office, Andersen said. Six apparatus from those crews responded as well. Roaring Fork Fire also helped Aspen Fire with coverage down in town, he said.,The Upper Colorado River Interagency Fire Management Unit also dispatched personnel and an engine to the scene.,“Obviously a big thanks to all of our partners for helping all of us out,” Andersen said.,Andersen noted that there was a tree that fell on a powerline in the area, and power was out to a portion of the Castle Creek area, he said. Holy Cross Energy went to the scene, he said.,The Holy Cross Energy outage map indicated that an outage reported around 4:30 p.m. in the Castle Creek area impacted 57 customers. The cause of the outage was “tree failure” without ice or snow, due to “wind, etc.” according to the map.

Scott Condon,"Basalt bartender’s disdain for local vodka triggers incident that leads to arrest on suspicion of menacing, assault","A Basalt bartender was arrested on suspicion of felony menacing, stalking and three misdemeanors after he allegedly went into a violent rage Tuesday when he learned a customer worked for Woody Creek Distillery.,Christopher D. Barker, 43, of Aspen Village, was arrested after a tense 20 minutes that included his alleged assault of his boss and another co-worker, pursuit of two customers outside of the restaurant and a confrontation with another man who intervened, according to Basalt Police Chief Greg Knott. Barker allegedly pulled a knife on the intervenor and the intervenor responded by pulling a handgun, according to an affidavit for a warrantless arrest filed in Eagle County District Court by Basalt police.,Knott said it was fortunate the episode didn’t end in tragedy after the intervenor pulled his handgun out of a holster during the chaotic moments when the first officer, Lt. Aaron Munch, arrived on the scene. The intervenor intended to show he posed no threat to officers but the action of pulling his gun could have easily been misconstrued, Knott said.,“Lt. Munch showed great restraint and control of the situation,” Knott said.,The arrest warrant said a woman was drinking at the Ocean restaurant’s bar in Willits Town Center with a male companion at about 4:30 p.m. Tuesday when Barker noticed the Woody Creek Distillery logo on the woman’s shirt.,“Christopher commented stating something to the effect of ‘Your vodka sucks,’” the arrest affidavit said. “Christopher continue to give his negative opinion on Woody Creek Distillery, making it extremely uncomfortable for (the woman and man).”,The customers decided to leave but Barker continued to be aggressive toward them, according to police. The owner of the restaurant and other employees tried to restrain Barker as he attempted to chase the man and woman as they departed. The owner later told police he feared Barker wanted to physically harm the woman.,Barker allegedly elbowed his boss in the face and punched him in the stomach as Barker attempted to get at the customers. Barker also allegedly slammed another co-worker’s hand in the door while employees were trying to prevent him from attacking the customers.,Several employees of the restaurant restrained Barker while the customers departed. The customers initially entered a neighboring restaurant but left when they found it too full. Meanwhile, the Ocean’s owner ordered Barker out of the restaurant.,Barker and the two customers made contact by chance about 1½ blocks away from Ocean restaurant. He flipped them off while they flipped him off, the affidavit said. Barker allegedly gave chase and the couple ducked into a nearby business seeking refuge.,“(The female customer) was hiding in one of the offices as (the male customer) and staff requested (Barker) leave,” the affidavit said.,The woman later told police she feared for her life while she was in hiding. She called a friend who lives nearby in Willits. The friend’s husband heard about the woman’s predicament and decided to help, Knott said. The intervenor went to the business where the woman was hiding and got into a physical altercation with Barker, according to witnesses.,Barker allegedly pulled out a knife used by bartenders to open wine bottles and threatened the intervenor, the affidavit said. The intervenor “showed Christopher that he had a gun,” the affidavit said. “Christopher continued to threaten (the intervenor) as he moved towards him. (The intervenor) then pulled the gun out and pointed it at Christopher.”,Barker dropped his knife shortly before Lt. Munch arrived at the scene. The 911 calls to police dispatch disclosed that weapons were involved, so Munch exited his car with his handgun drawn.,Munch encountered a scene at the sidewalk along Robinson Street with one man screaming (Barker) and another man (the intervenor) a short distance away with a pistol visible in his holster, according to footage from Munch’s body cam. The Aspen Times reviewed that footage.,Munch ordered the man with the gun to get down on his knees and as the man started to comply, he calmly pulled his pistol out of the holster and set it on the ground. Munch was clearly concerned while the man was pulling out the handgun and screamed at the man to get face down to the ground and then crawl away from the gun. Almost simultaneously he ordered Barker to sit on the sidewalk. Another officer arrived and both men were placed in handcuffs for “investigative custody,” the affidavit said.,Knott said he interviewed the man who intervened in the dispute and learned he had intended to show he was compliant when he removed the pistol from the holster. He said he later realized his action could have been construed differently by the police officer, according to Knott.,The intervenor wasn’t arrested though Basalt police asked the 5th Judicial District Attorney’s Office to review the incident and rule whether a charge was warranted.,Multiple witnesses, some with videos, confirmed that the intervenor pulled his handgun only after Barker made threats with a knife and allegedly yelled “I’m going to kill you,” according to the affidavit.,Officer Nino Santiago questioned Barker and said he smelled alcohol on Barker’s breath. Barker admitted he was drinking that day and that he had experienced some mental health issues, the affidavit said.,Barker was arrested on suspicion of two counts of third-degree assault for actions against two of his co-workers who tried to restrain him at Ocean. He was also arrested on suspicion of criminal mischief for other actions at the restaurant.,Barker was arrested on a charge of suspicion of stalking, a class 5 felony, for following the female and male customers out of Ocean.

Carolyn Sackariason,Income increases for workers to be addressed in Aspen’s housing program,"With a workforce shortage facing the resort community, many local employers are giving raises or bonuses to their employees, but those workers then face eviction of their rental units because they make too much money based on the income category they were approved for in the Aspen-Pitkin County Housing Authority program.,To address that conundrum, the APCHA board on Wednesday tentatively agreed to change the agency’s regulations to increase the exception to income for current tenants from 120% to 150% when they requalify.,“We have seen a slew of folks that have either just been requalified or about to be that are over their category and are going to be told they are out of compliance and have 12 months (to move out) and there’s nowhere for them to go,” APCHA co-Deputy Director Bethany Spitz said.,That’s the case for Monty Love and his wife, Megan Ballard, who rent an apartment at Truscott and were told they are out of compliance because their projected income is over the limit for their unit.,“I’m here on our behalf but more for our community in the midst of understaffing and hiring difficulties in our community, which is constantly in need of more affordable housing,” he told the APCHA board during public comment in ,. “It is time for APCHA to update or change their regulations, and here’s the change that I think is necessary — increase income limits for rentals, increase income limits to match current wage increases and or inflation, do not evict good-standing tenants and workers until their unit can be filled with new occupants.”,Kelly McNicholas Kury, APCHA board member and Pitkin County commissioner, said the county has in the past year given its employees as much as 10% raises.,“That has caused people to be overqualified for their housing, and I think (APCHA) had decided to keep the (area median income) low coming out of the pandemic because of job loss and hours cut,” she said. “So it seems something to revisit, because everyone’s getting raises across the valley right now, so I don’t think this is going to be a problem limited to just a handful.”,Cindy Christensen, co-deputy director of APCHA, said the agency is sticking with 2020 incomes because of the lingering effects of the pandemic.,Those who rent in APCHA units must requalify every two years, and if they are found to be out of compliance, they are notified that they have to come back into good standing within 12 months, according to Spitz.,“Basically we are saying you have to make less money, or for the income caps to go back up,” she said.,The change in the regulations may help Love and Ballard, but it’s not certain.,“It’s almost a welfare state: don’t make money or you are going to lose your house,” Love said.,APCHA board member and Aspen City Councilwoman Rachel Richards said she supports the idea of increasing qualifying income levels to 150% and suggested that perhaps those individuals should pay more rent in exchange.,“It shouldn’t be that they get the same rent as someone who’s 10% below that category cap, so it needs to be readjusted there,” she said. “It’s for the good of the project and maintenance.”,APCHA staff will work on a formalized resolution that the board can consider on first and second reading before the regulation can be amended.,The change would likely be reviewed annually, and for how long individuals could use the exception is still a question that officials haven’t resolved.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/income-increases-for-workers-to-be-addressed-in-aspens-housing-program/,2022-05-05
Scott Condon,Who says recycling doesn’t pay? Pitkin County finds new use for old asphalt from airport,"The Aspen-Pitkin County Airport’s intended loss is the Brush Creek parking lot’s unexpected gain.,Asphalt being shaved from the taxiway, tarmac and runway at the airport is being recycled to cover a gravel lot at the intersection of Brush Creek Road and Highway 82. The recycling will save Pitkin County “hundreds of thousands of dollars,” said public works director Brian Pettet.,The initial plan was to haul the shaved material, called millings, to the landfill from the airport. There it would have been piled, stored and used as projects arose.,Instead, the airport, public works and road and bridge department teamed to divert the millings straight to the Brush Creek lot. Pettet said about 5,400 tons of asphalt are being removed from the airport. About 200 tons will be retained for various projects there. That leaves 5,200 tons for use elsewhere by the county. Most of that will be used at the Brush Creek lot.,Pettet said an existing gravel lot that is 550 feet by 200 feet will be covered, or about 110,000 square feet. Dump trucks are transporting the material. Two graders are spreading it and then a roller is compressing it.,The asphalt is compressing surprisingly well, Pettet said. He is uncertain how long it will hold up.,“We’ll assess it over time,” Pettet said. “With this, it’s wait-and-see. Right now it looks fantastic.”,He credited the experienced road and bridge staff the applying the expertise to make the plan work.,If the material lasts for five years, that defers a major expense for the county, he noted. Whenever it has to be replaced, it provides an excellent base that will help an upper layer last longer, he said.,The recycling project is saving money is numerous ways. First, it saves the airport money because of the reduced hauling distance to the Brush Creek lot rather than the dump. Second, it saves the county money from storing and eventually hauling the millings out of the dump. And third, it’s helping Pitkin County stretch its dollars further with the Brush Creek lot revamp.,Covering the Brush Creek gravel lot with fresh asphalt would cost a minimum of $15 per ton plus the grading work, Pettet said. Avoiding that expense produces the major savings.,The savings will allow Pitkin County to devote funds to new bathrooms and associated water and sewage treatment at the lot. The plan is to improve the lot to make it more attractive to commuters who would use it for bus rides into Aspen and Snowmass Village.,Meanwhile, the repaving at the airport and other maintenance will be finished by May 16.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/who-says-recycling-doesnt-pay-pitkin-county-finds-new-use-for-old-asphalt-from-airport/,2022-05-06

He was wanted for the fatal shooting of an 18-year-old male at the celebration on Home Ranch Road shortly after midnight Sunday.,Garfield County Sheriff’s deputies arrived to find the victim still alive, but he was later pronounced dead at St. Mary’s Hospital in Grand Junction.,Garfield County District Court Judge Paul Metzger made the order to detain Lopez without bond during the Rifle juvenile’s initial appearance Tuesday morning.,“Under these circumstances, having reviewed the affidavit and considered the arguments of the parties, I do ultimately conclude that the juvenile poses a substantial risk of serious harm to others, and therefore find that he should remain in detention at this time,” Metzger said.,According to prosecuting attorney Tony Hershey, Lopez was already on probation for felony menacing with a knife prior to his Monday arrest. Meanwhile, Lopez also allegedly possessed two handguns and brass knuckles when he was arrested by the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office on Monday.,“After the incident in this case, (Lopez) did flee the county, he went to Mesa County,” Hershey said. “I believe at some point he was contacted by his mother and sister, and that’s when he was apprehended.”,Garfield County public defender Elise Myer requested Lopez be released from detention because he does not pose a flight risk and that facts in connection to his new homicide case are currently “limited.”,Myer also said Lopez has been abiding to the terms of his probation and was working concrete with his father prior to his Monday arrest.,“These are incredibly serious crimes, but he is presumed innocent,” Myer said. “D’Antiago is willing to abide by any conditions the court may put on a release. He is happy to stay at home with his family, to not leave. He has a good relationship with his family, with his parents, with his siblings.”,Lopez’s next court date is set for May 11.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/rifle-juvenile-suspected-in-fatal-shooting-held-without-bond-judge-orders/,2022-04-27

Rick Carroll,Teen paints harrowing picture of relative’s alleged abuse in Roaring Fork Valley,"A Pitkin County district judge Monday bound over a Rifle man for trial to face 168 criminal charges linked to his alleged physical, psychological and sexual abuse of a relative over a period of two years, including one incident where he purportedly tried to shove her off a cliff on Aspen Mountain.,Defendant Frank Seme, 44, out on a $250,000 surety bond, attended in Aspen the preliminary hearing that included brief remarks from the alleged victim, who was subpoenaed to testify by public defender Scott Troxell. Also shown during the hearing was video footage of a police detective’s interview with the girl, who said she was physically and sexually abused and traumatized by her relative starting when she was 16 years old. The physical abuse began in September 2018 and the sexual abuse in February 2019, the girl told the detective.,“If it wasn’t sexual abuse, it was physical abuse and verbal abuse,” the alleged victim told the Rifle Police Sgt. Carlos Cornejo in the interview, which was conducted Oct. 28. Nearly three hours of the interview was shown during the preliminary hearing.,Judge Chris Seldin’s ruling allows the prosecution to carry forward 53 felony counts of sexual assault against Seme, 30 felony counts of sexual assault on a child by a person in a position of trust constituting a pattern of abuse, 83 felony counts of aggravated incest, one count of second-degree assault and one misdemeanor count of third-degree assault.,Convictions on all charges could lead to multiple life sentences in prison for Seme. The sexual assault charges are punishable by 2 to 6 years to life in prison; the incest counts carry 4 to 12 years to life in prison; and each count of sexual assault on a child by a person in a position of trust constituting a pattern of abuse is punishable by 10 to 32 years to life in prison.,Seldin noted his decision was largely based on the video of the girl’s interview with the Rifle police sergeant, as well as her documenting each alleged sexual encounter — including multiple instances of intercourse — on her health app’s calendar.,“We have non-hearsay testimony to support the charge in each count,” Judge Seldin said.,According to the alleged victim’s statement to police, she moved from her home in Nebraska to her relative’s Old Snowmass-area home in June 2018, and began her junior year at a high school in the Roaring Fork Valley that fall. In September just before her 17th birthday, Seme became mad at her and beat her with a hairbrush. He was intoxicated then and normally would drink 12 beers a day, she said.,The sexual abuse began in the following February and became progressively worse.,“It’s been going on since I was 17 and we lived in Snowmass,” she told Cornejo.,The alleged victim said she couldn’t break away from her relative because she felt helpless. She also told Rifle police that before her interview with them, she spent 25 minutes outside the department before she could gather herself to tell her story.,“I feel stupid for letting this go on that long … and I feel guilty for never fighting back,” she said.,The girl recalled an episode in July 2019, one day before she was scheduled to take her senior pictures, when the relative took her four-wheeling up the backside of Aspen Mountain. At one point the vehicle stopped, and he wrapped a seat belt around her neck in an attempt to rape her but she was able to break free, she told Rifle police.,“We were in the middle of nowhere,” she said. “I didn’t have a cellphone; I didn’t have anything.”,Seme later tried to push her off a cliff but did not succeed, she said.,“He dislocated his shoulder and screamed at me and said it was my fault,” she told police.,The following October the two went to a show at Belly Up Aspen, and on the way back, while the girl was driving them home, Seme demanded she stop the car and have sex with him, she said. He also was drunk at the time, she told authorities.,She resisted then and he struck her, and when they returned home she became sick before he sexually assaulted her, she said.,“The threats and fear, what she felt, were the means and consequences that allowed [Seme] to continue the abuse,” Nottingham said during closing statements.,After her relative kicked her out of his home in October, the victim reported the crimes to police in Rifle, where Seme was living then. Cornejo later notified Pitkin County authorities about the crimes the girl reported that occurred in Pitkin County.,Seme is out on $250,000 surety bond after authorities arrested him in December. He is due back court in June 6 for an arraignment hearing.,Monday’s hearing was held in a makeshift courtroom downstairs at the old Aspen City Hall building, while renovations continue at Pitkin County Courthouse on Main Street.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/teen-paints-harrowing-picture-of-relatives-alleged-abuse-in-roaring-fork-valley/,2022-04-26
John Stroud,Bond review scheduled in Glenwood Springs stabbing ahead of defendant’s 18th birthday,"A juvenile defendant charged as an adult for attempted murder in a March 8 stabbing incident at a south Glenwood Springs home had his first hearing in adult court Thursday.,The next step before Angel Rivas Tellez turns 18 on May 13 will be to review a $250,000 bond that was set last month when the 9th District Attorney’s Office charged him as an adult and refiled his case in Garfield County District Court.,Once Tellez turns 18, he will have to be transferred from the Grand Mesa Youth Detention Center to the Garfield County Jail, unless he is able to make bond, public defender Elise Myer told District Judge James Boyd at the Thursday hearing.,Boyd agreed to set a bond review hearing ahead of that key date, the afternoon of April 22.,At a March 23 juvenile court hearing, Myer requested a much lower bond of $15,000-$20,000.,Myer also anticipates requesting what’s called a reverse-transfer hearing, where the judge would be asked to determine if the case should be moved back to juvenile court.,That’s unlikely to occur until a clinical psychologist can evaluate Tellez and provide a report. The earliest that could happen is June 9, Myer said.,In the meantime, she said she is still reviewing discovery from the police investigation in the case, including body camera footage and medical records of the alleged victim.,Tellez faces felony charges of attempted murder and burglary for allegedly breaking into the victim’s home using a crowbar on a basement window around 2 a.m. March 8, going to the man’s bedroom and stabbing him “at least 30 times” before fleeing the scene, according to an account provided by Deputy District Attorney Tony Hershey at the March court hearing.,The victim was transported to an area hospital and survived his injuries.,At the Thursday hearing, Hershey asked that a protection order in place for the victims in the case, including a third-party acquaintance of Tellez and the victim, be transferred from the juvenile case to the new District Court case. Judge Boyd agreed.,In the earlier hearing, Hershey painted a picture of a premeditated crime in which Tellez allegedly played crime games with friends and kept notes on how to break into a home with the intent of committing a violent crime.,Following the incident, the surrounding neighborhood was initially on high alert while Glenwood Springs police investigated. Tellez was quickly identified as a likely suspect, and police indicated there was not an immediate public threat.,Hershey said at the March 23 hearing that there were enough concerns expressed by officials at Tellez’s school in Glenwood Springs that the higher bond is warranted. Additional evidence has been provided on that front, Hershey said Thursday.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/bond-review-scheduled-in-glenwood-springs-stabbing-ahead-of-defendants-18th-birthday/,2022-04-09

Jason Auslander,Jury finds Basalt man guilty of attack on woman in bar bathroom,"A Pitkin County jury on Monday found a Basalt man guilty of attempted sexual assault, false imprisonment and indecent exposure for attacking an Aspen visitor in the bathroom of a downtown bar last summer.,Robert Marlow, 41, now faces possible life in prison when he is sentenced June 21.,The jury of seven women and five men spent nearly all of Friday afternoon and all of Monday morning deliberating before coming back with the verdict just before 1 p.m. In addition to the findings of guilt on all counts, jurors also found that Marlow used “force of violence” in attempting to sexually assault the then-23-year-old woman.,That finding is particularly significant because it means Marlow is guilty of a higher level felony and will face 2-to-6 years to life in prison and 10 years to life on parole when and if he’s released from prison, said Deputy District Attorney Don Nottingham, who prosecuted the case. Marlow would have been looking at between 1 and 3 years in prison if the jury had found him guilty of attempted sexual assault without the force of violence finding.,Indecent exposure and false imprisonment are misdemeanors for which Marlow can receive up to 18 months and up to 364 days respectively.,The Pitkin County Probation Department will conduct both a pre-sentence investigation and psycho-sexual evaluation prior to the June sentencing date.,Attorneys in the case spent almost as much time picking the jury as they did presenting evidence in the case. Jury selection took all of April 5 and half of the next day. Testimony and arguments in the case occurred Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning and Friday morning.,The first witness to testify was the now-24-year-old victim in the case, a resident of Washington, D.C., , she had been coming to visit Aspen her entire life because her parents met here.,She described a night out July 6 with a family friend that finished up at Aspen Public House about 1 a.m. July 7. The woman said she’d had two glasses of wine the entire night, ordered water at the Public House bar when she arrived, then went to use the bathroom about 15 minutes later.,She said she first went to the women’s bathroom, but when she opened the door she encountered Marlow standing inside with his pants unbuttoned. She described being slightly embarrassed, apologized and shut the door.,The woman said she decided to use the men’s bathroom immediately across from the women’s bathroom on the assumption that it was a one-toilet facility like the women’s room and likely had a locking door. When she opened the door, however, she noticed it was set up differently with a urinal and a stall and said she hesitated a moment while deciding if she should use that bathroom.,That was when she said a clearly intoxicated Marlow came “barging” through the door, backed her up against the wall between the urinal and the sink, put his right arm up to block her from leaving and began pulling down his pants and boxers. She said he exposed himself to her at that point.,The woman, who is much smaller than the 6-foot-1, 260 pound Marlow, said she asked him not to do anything to her and to let her go, but he responded, “You’re not going anywhere.” She said she then began screaming, punching and kicking at Marlow and was able to duck under his arm and run out the door to safety.,She later said she thought he would have raped her if she hadn’t been able to get away. A video surveillance camera outside the bathroom recorded her screams and her running away from the bathroom area.,Marlow testified that he’d been drinking and doing cocaine that night and that while he remembered most details, including arriving at Public House, sitting at a table outside the bathroom and getting up to go to the bathroom to do more cocaine, he didn’t remember what occurred inside the bathroom except for the woman screaming.,Marlow is currently being held at the Garfield County Jail, which is housing Pitkin County Jail inmates while county officials make changes to the jail to improve safety.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/jury-finds-basalt-man-guilty-of-attack-on-woman-in-bar-bathroom/,2022-04-12
Jason Auslander,Jurors to resume deliberations Monday in attempted sex assault trial,"After spending most of Friday afternoon deliberating the fate of a Basalt man charged with attempting to rape an Aspen visitor in the bathroom of a downtown bar last summer, jurors were sent home after 5 p.m. without coming to a verdict.,Deliberations will resume Monday morning.,Robert Marlow, 41, is charged with attempted sexual assault, false imprisonment and indecent exposure in relation to the incident, which occurred at Aspen Public House in the early morning hours of July 7.,Jurors received the case about 12:30 p.m. after lawyers concluded closing arguments and deliberated until about 5:20 p.m., when District Judge Chris Seldin called them back into the courtroom to check on their progress. At least two jurors indicated they had other obligations and could not continue the deliberations Friday evening, and Seldin sent them home for the weekend.,The 24-year-old victim in the case — a resident of Washington, D.C. — testified Wednesday that a drunken Marlow followed her in to a bathroom at Public House about 1 a.m., forced her up against the wall, blocked her from leaving, pulled down his pants and boxers and told her she couldn’t leave. The woman, who was convinced she was about to be raped, said she screamed, then kicked and punched Marlow before ducking under his arm and running out.,Marlow testified in his own defense Friday and told jurors he worked as a heavy equipment operator in Glenwood Springs during the day on July 6, then met a friend for two beers at a brewery nearby. He said he returned to his home at Aspen Skiing Co.’s tiny-home development — he worked for Skico as a lift mechanic the previous winter — in the mid-Roaring Fork Valley, where he ate and showered.,Marlow said he then drove to Aspen and went to Eric’s Bar, where he was employed as a security doorman but was not on duty that night, and had five beers and two shots. He also said he “scored” a gram of cocaine from a co-worker at the bar and did two or three “key bumps” in the bathroom.,Marlow testified that he’d done cocaine more than 50 times before, but that this time it affected him differently and made him sluggish and discombobulated instead of stimulated. Not long after ingesting the cocaine, he said his co-worker noticed he was very intoxicated and asked him to leave the bar “before you make an ass of yourself.”,“I definitely appeared pretty wasted to him,” Marlow said.,He then walked over the Aspen Public House, where he said he was thinking of doing more cocaine. He testified that he remembered sitting down at a table near the bathrooms and remembered getting up to go to the bathroom to do more drugs.,That was when Marlow said he remembered hearing a woman scream, but had “no clue what was going on.”,“Obviously there was a woman in the bathroom and she ran out the door,” he said.,He then left the bar after a bartender asked him to go, and walked around Aspen aimlessly looking for his car while hallucinating lights and colors until 4:30 a.m. When police showed up at his home two days later, Marlow said he didn’t know why they were there and thought maybe he’d gotten into a fight.,Prosecutor Don Nottingham, however, played a video of Marlow’s interview with an Aspen Police detective, where he said he remembered a girl screaming. Marlow then admitted he knew the police visit had to do with his interaction in the bathroom with the woman who screamed.,Marlow said he “froze” when he heard the scream and recalled the woman running out the bathroom door.,“Anybody that screams like that — it is terrifying,” he said. “Because it is an emergency sound. They were loud. They were very scary — like horror movie screams. It did scare me and it did make me freeze.”,Nottingham pointed out that Marlow appeared to remember many details of the night, except the 15 seconds when the victim screamed, kicked and punched her way out of the bathroom, the audio of which was recorded on a video surveillance camera outside the bathrooms. Marlow confirmed that he did not remember what happened inside the bathroom.,“Of course, that’s when his memory goes blank,” Nottingham said in his closing arguments. “If he wasn’t trying to sexually assault her in the Public House bathroom, what could he possibly have been doing? What other possible explanation can there be for that? There is none.”,Scott Troxell, Marlow’s public defender, cast doubt on the victim’s version of events, criticized police for not gathering DNA evidence or even photos of the victim’s alleged bruises and said the facts “fall short of what is alleged by the prosecution.” He said her clothes were not ruffled or stretched and that there was no proof Marlow committed any act of force on her.,“(The victim) was traumatized,” Troxell said. “But that doesn’t mean everything that came out of her mouth (in testimony) was the truth.”,He said Marlow never assaulted the woman.,“I ask you to find that Mr. Marlow did not commit any act of force on the victim,” Troxell said. “If anything, it was unlawful sexual contact.”",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/jurors-to-resume-deliberations-monday-in-attempted-sex-assault-trial/,2022-04-09
Scott Condon,Additional alleged victims emerge in sex case against Basalt massage therapist,"The list of alleged victims continues to grow in the sex case against a former massage therapist in Basalt.,A preliminary hearing against Nathaniel “Nate” Gordon was postponed Monday at the request of his attorney, but the prosecutor in the case said Gordon now is facing 21 counts. The charges include one count of sexual assault to multiple counts of unlawful sexual contact and invasion of privacy, according to Johnny Lombardi, a deputy district attorney in the 5th Judicial District Attorney’s Office.,DA Heidi McCollum said after a brief hearing that there are now 11 named victims in the case.,Gordon, 47, of New Castle, was arrested Nov. 24 by Basalt police after one of the victims contended Gordon inappropriately touched her during a massage at a Basalt business on Nov. 22. By early January, the list of alleged victims , and the alleged inappropriate touching went back to 2015 in at least one case.,Gordon was released from Eagle County Jail in late November on a $25,000 personal recognizance bond. His bond conditions prohibit him from contacting the alleged victims or working as a massage therapist while the case is active.,The Basalt Police Department posted a message on its Facebook page Jan. 28 urging any victims to contact the department, the DA’s office or RESPONSE, which helps victims of sexual assaults.,“We believe there may be other women who were victimized by Nate Gordon while he was working as a massage therapist,” Lt. Aaron Munch said in the Facebook post.,McCollum said Monday her office continues to be contacted by potential victims in the case.,Four of the alleged victims appeared in court in Eagle on Monday and were prepared to testify in the preliminary hearing. Gordon’s attorney, Sherry Caloia, sought a continuance because she said she didn’t have enough time to look through all the evidence the DA’s office has presented in the case thus far. Plus, Caloia said, she had a severe head cold that affected her ability to represent Gordon effectively.,Eagle County Judge Rachel Olquin-Fresquez said she was “not comfortable” with either choice — proceeding with the preliminary hearing or granting the continuance. She decided to reschedule the hearing for April 22. The DA’s office must prove there is enough evidence to warrant advancing to trial on the charges facing Gordon.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/additional-alleged-victims-emerge-in-sex-case-against-basalt-massage-therapist/,2022-04-05
Rick Carroll,"Fornell cops plea over spray-paint job, doesn’t apologize to Gorsuch","With Jeff Gorsuch and his attorney seated footsteps away, Aspen resident Peter Fornell pleaded guilty Wednesday to the municipal offense of injuring public/private property, apologized to city officials and the court for spray-painting the messages “Liars Go Back to Vail” on the exterior of Gorsuch Ski Cafe, and vowed not to commit a similar offense in the future.,Fornell accepted a plea agreement with the City Attorney’s Office requiring him to pay a $100 fine and $50 in court costs. The agreement includes a six-month deferred judgment, meaning the conviction will be removed from Fornell’s record if he isn’t cited for any criminal transgressions through the first week of October. The city has 90 days to request a restitution amount from Fornell, which he can either accept or challenge, said Assistant City Attorney Kate Johnson.,Fornell turned himself in to Aspen police March 7, admitting to them that he spray-painted the cafe, which is located at the base of Aspen Mountain near the gondola.

The paint was removed the next day, which was a Sunday.,“I’m here today to admit my actions at the Gorsuch Cafe on March 5,” Fornell read from a statement to the court Wednesday. “I acted in an irresponsible way and I regret my methods. It was ill-conceived and a poor attempt to exercise my right to free speech. Had I taken time to assess the situation, I would have taken a more healthy approach to expressing my opinion.”,Fornell’s remarks came after Judge Brooke Peterson allowed Gorsuch to give a statement, which began when he pulled up a seat near Fornell, looked him in the face and said, “Honestly, I don’t know you well. I don’t know what could have possibly been in your mind thinking this was the right behavior.”,Peterson then stopped Gorsuch.,“Mr. Gorsuch, address me,” the judge said.,Gorsuch then turned to Peterson and said Fornell’s actions went too far and harmed a family that has been part of the community for more than a half-century.,“What happened that Sunday morning or the evening before is not acceptable behavior in the community, in the city and the community where we all strive to do a good job and take care of guests, and my guests were greeted by that violent red paint that basically called me and my family liars and said ‘leave and go away from here,’” Gorsuch said. “And you know what, we’ve been in the Aspen and the retail community for 50 years. And we’ve tried to do a lot of right things for the community and supporting the community we live and work in.,“I find the behavior despicable and wrong and the slippery slope that it was on caused great havoc in the public and in my presence, in my business, to my people that work for me and to my family that lives here.”,Gorsuch’s attorney Matt Ferguson argued the case belonged in either county or district court where misdemeanor and felony cases are handled and punishments are more severe.,“If you watched the news this morning, you’ll see what the Russian troops have been doing — putting V’s all over municipal buildings there (in Ukraine),” Ferguson said. “When people destroy windows, it means a lot in our society. These things have happened, and when you write something like ‘liars’ and ‘get out of town’ and ‘go back to Vail,’ that’s intimidation. And that’s what Jeff and Jeff Gorsuch’s family felt, that’s what his children feel. They’ve been yelled at in cars because of this incident. They’re scared. This is the wrong thing to do.”,Fornell , he was outraged after Gorsuch and his partners flipped nearly an acre of land on Aspen Mountain ,after buying it for $10 million from Aspen Skiing Co. the previous July.,The flipped land came with entitlements to build a voter-approved hotel, and was acquired by an affiliate of a Miami-based developer of luxury hotels called OKO Group, which is led by Russian-born billionaire Vladislav Doronin.,The local team of Jim DeFrancia, Gorsuch and Bryan Peterson were the face of the 2019 campaign for an 81-room Gorsuch Haus to be built at the base of the west side of Aspen Mountain near Lift One. That March, Aspen’s electorate approved the Gorsuch Haus and associated developments by 26 votes.,Fornell, himself a developer, also apologized to a number of people with one notable exception.,“I want to extend my apologies to the Aspen Police Department for occupying their time,” Fornell’s statement continued. “My apologies also go to the Aspen City Attorney’s Office for having to deal with this matter. Finally, I apologize to the court. And to your honor, you have far more important matters to attend to. I regret that I have taken your valuable time and I am truly sorry. Be certain that I take this matter seriously and I intend to live up to the obligations of the plea agreement. I try to be a good citizen, and I know that my future actions will show that I’m capable of doing so.”,Ferguson then pointed out the omission.,“I would like to note who was not apologized to,” Ferguson said.,Replied Judge Peterson: “I got it.”,The Aspen Municipal Code describes the charge against Fornell — injury to public and private property prohibited — as “unlawful for any person to intentionally or knowingly to injure, deface, mutilate, remove, pull down, break or in any way interfere with or molest or secrete any trees, real or personal property belonging to or under the control of the City or any person within the City.”,Johnson said the plea agreement with Fornell is similar to other deals the city has made for the same offense. She also noted Fornell does not have a criminal history, which factored into the outcome.,“I appreciate the victim’s statements here, but I do have to say that I think this is a fair and just resolution to these charges,” Johnson said. “It is similar to other situations that this court has addressed on the charge of injuring private property. There have been similar situations that have happened in town. Again, this has a political flair to it but the actual act itself is similar to other acts this court has dealt with.”,Peterson agreed the agreement was appropriate.,“I note and recognize that Mr. Fornell, at least in my knowledge, has not apologized to the Gorsuch family and to Mr. Gorsuch, but that’s his decision and I cannot force an apology out of him,” the judge said. “That being said, I still believe the stipulation is the right way to deal with the criminal aspect of these actions, and the restitution issue remains to be seen. But for the moment and until that restitution comes back to me, the matter is closed as far as the stipulation is concerned.”,The judge said he had to treat Fornell like any other defendant charged with the same offense, despite the high-profile nature of the vandalism.,“I recognize that this has been hurtful to the Gorsuch family, but I’m not sure that this court can impose a higher penalty to change that,” he said.,As a member of the Aspen Historic Preservation Commission’s board of directors, Fornell has a responsibility to behave well, Ferguson said.,“Mr. Fornell sits on the HPC board and he’s supposed to show good judgment,” Ferguson said. “What he did was an abomination. You can’t tell people to leave town and call them liars.”,It cost Gorsuch around $2,500 to remove the spray-paint job, which was not water based, Ferguson said. Fornell said previously he intentionally used easy-to-remove water-based red paint.,There could be future civil action over the incident, Ferguson said.,“The bottom line is we’ve been pressing the DA to take this up as a misdemeanor or a minor felony because he has done damage,” Ferguson said. “We don’t think it was water-based paint. It took the entire day to get that paint off and it did cost about $2,500. In addition, Mr. Gorsuch has had to retain publicists and put in numerous ads in the papers, run his letters, and try to rebut some of the damage that has been done here.”,The Gorsuch family is known for their skiing prowess, evidenced by Jeff Gorsuch’s 2019 induction into the Colorado Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame, joining his parents and grandfather. The family name also can be seen on ski apparel shops throughout the state. Jeff Gorsuch’s father, ,, is considered one of Vail’s pioneers. He died in June.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/fornell-cops-plea-over-spray-paint-job-doesnt-apologize-to-gorsuch/,2022-04-07
Jason Auslander,Three victims in Independence Pass hostage case awarded $1.4 million,"A District Court judge has awarded $1.4 million to three men who were held hostage at gunpoint by a delusional Colorado Springs real estate agent on Independence Pass nearly six years ago.,The amount was the maximum allowed under Colorado law for “non-economic losses” that includes emotional distress and pain suffering, though it fell short of the $2.25 million sought from Brolin McConnell by the three men.,“We’re really happy with this,” Michael Fox, the Aspen-based lawyer for the three men, said Monday. “Ultimately, whether they got $2.25 million or $1.4 million, it doesn’t matter. My clients … are just looking to close this chapter in their lives.”,Ninth Judicial District Judge John Neiley, who is based in Glenwood Springs, entered the award late Friday afternoon after a ,March 21 during which Brian Buchanan, Mark Meredith and Blake Ramelb testified about the lasting trauma McConnell inflicted on them during the incident on ,.,McConnell did not participate in the virtual trial last week, though Neiley found that McConnell had received notice of the trial and even waited an extra 10 minutes for him to log on before beginning the proceedings.,In his ruling, Neiley wrote that the men — who were in the their early-to-mid 20s at the time — demonstrated during their testimony “that they suffered significant emotional and psychological injuries and severe emotional distress as a direct and proximate result of McConnell’s conduct.”,“He held them at gunpoint and completely terrorized them,” Neiley said. “The conduct was so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.”,Under Colorado law, the maximum allowed in nonmedical malpractice civil cases for noneconomic loss or injury is $250,000, “unless the court finds ‘justification’ by clear and convincing evidence to award a greater amount,” Neiley said in his ruling. The current cap for those maximum damages is $468,010, which he awarded to each of the three plaintiffs, because of the severity of McConnell’s conduct, according to the ruling.,Neiley declined to award more because higher amounts generally come only with loss of limbs, loss of senses “or other similar physically traumatic injuries.”,“While the court does not mean to minimize the emotional trauma suffered by the Plaintiffs, none of them suffered permanent physical injuries or disfigurement, lost a limb or suffered a gunshot wound,” Neiley said. “With appropriate therapy and counseling, there is significant hope that the emotional impacts of the incident can be ameliorated over time.”,Buchanan and Meredith first encountered McConnell’s stopped truck on Lincoln Creek Road on their way to do some bouldering and camping. McConnell pulled out two handguns, made them partially disrobe and repeatedly threatened to kill them before they were able to escape without injury.,Ramelb drove up on the scene and was also taken hostage. McConnell fired one of the guns at Ramelb’s feet and also next to his head before he, too, was able to escape without injury despite having recently had surgery on his foot.,After spending 3½ years awaiting trial in the Pitkin County Jail — which included numerous delays after he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and was eventually found sane — , to criminal attempt to commit first-degree kidnapping and felony menacing.,Pitkin County District Judge Chris Seldin, who said McConnell was experiencing “paranoid delusions” when he held the men hostage, sentenced him to 12 years in prison in March 2020. McConnell served less than two years before he was released on parole in January and is currently living in Texas.,Efforts to collect the $1.4 million can come in the form of garnishing wages, bank accounts or real property, Fox said.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/three-victims-in-independence-pass-hostage-case-awarded-1-4-million/,2022-03-29
John Stroud,Juvenile defendant in Glenwood Springs stabbing charged as adult,"The juvenile defendant accused of stabbing a south Glenwood Springs resident after breaking into his home in the early morning hours of March 8 is being charged as an adult.,Angel Rivas Tellez, 17, will have to answer to felony charges of attempted murder and burglary before District Judge James Boyd, after the new charges were filed this week by 9th District Attorney Jeff Cheney.,Tellez’s juvenile case was dismissed Wednesday by Garfield County Judge Paul Metzger, who also set bond at $250,000.,Tellez appeared before Metzger via videoconference from a juvenile detention center in Mesa County. He will remain in the juvenile facility while his case is pending, at least until he turns 18.,Deputy District Attorney Tony Hershey asked for a higher bond of $500,000 due to serious concerns around community safety and the possibility Tellez may try to flee to his native Mexico.,“If he does, we may never see him again,” Hershey said. “The victim is scared to death he might get out and try to finish the job.”,Hershey painted a picture of a premeditated crime in which Tellez allegedly had been keeping notes on how to break into a home with the intent of committing a violent crime.,Around 2 a.m. March 8, Tellez allegedly used a crowbar to pry open a basement window and knew which bedroom to find the victim, who Hershey said was stabbed “at least 30 times” before Tellez fled the scene.,The victim was transported to an area hospital and survived his injuries.,Public defender Elise Myer acknowledged that Tellez has had behavioral issues at his school but said that he had been subjected to bullying and comes from a family with a history of domestic violence.,She asked that a much lower bond of $15,000 or $20,000 be set, instead. She said Tellez has strong support from his mother and a “father figure” who is now in his life.,Both his mother and the man spoke on Tellez’s behalf in court on Wednesday, asking for the lower bond amount and that the case remain in juvenile court.,Tellez is due back in court before Judge Boyd on April 7 for a return on formal filing in the case.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/juvenile-defendant-in-glenwood-springs-stabbing-charged-as-adult/,2022-03-23
Jason Auslander,Teen charged with assault after striking woman with snowball from Aspen hotel roof,"A 19-year-old tourist from Chicago allegedly hit a woman walking down the street in the face with a snowball from the fourth floor roof of a downtown hotel last weekend, according to a police report.,In addition, the teen’s mother allegedly tried repeatedly to shield her son from talking to police and was also charged in the case, the report states.,“We don’t usually write people up for a friendly snowball fight,” Aspen Assistant Police Chief Bill Linn said Thursday. “But when someone gets hit like this, it’s way over the line.”,Drew Benson Peters was charged with misdemeanor third-degree assault and Maia Benson, 56, also of Chicago, was charged with obstructing an officer.,“Interestingly, neither Drew or his mother asked about the well-being of the woman who had been hit with the snowball,” Aspen police Officer Roderick O’Connor wrote in his report.,The incident began at 10:45 p.m. on March 18 after a 60-year-old Texas man and his 56-year-old wife told police they’d been walking past the W Hotel on South Spring Street after dinner when the woman was struck in the face with a snowball, according to the police report.,When officers met with the woman, “her lower left lip was red and swollen” and “she was angry,” the report states. She declined an ambulance.,After his wife was hit, the man told police he looked up and saw a young man four stories up on the W Hotel’s pool deck.,“He spoke with the W Hotel security and they told him they had trouble with two 19-year-old males from earlier in the day, who were throwing snowballs from the pool area,” according to the police report, which was requested Monday by The Aspen Times and released Thursday.,O’Connor was unable to track down Peters late Friday night, but received an email from the W Hotel’s director of security when he arrived for work Saturday evening. The security director told him that an employee of the Little Nell Hotel — next door to the W Hotel — had called at 7 a.m. March 18 and said two young men had been throwing snowballs from the W’s fourth-floor pool deck, the report states.,W Hotel security went to the roof at that time, stopped the two 19-year-olds — who admitted throwing the snowballs — and recorded the room in which they were staying. After the Texas woman was struck in the face that night, the W’s security director found a surveillance camera image of the man suspected of throwing the snowball and was able to track him to the same room, according to the police report.,O’Connor knocked on the room’s door about 8 p.m. Saturday but no one answered so he left his card. He returned later the same night, found the card gone, knocked again to no avail and left a second card. At that time, he learned that the occupants of the room were with the occupants of another nearby room, and he knocked on that door.,Benson answered and tried to “negotiate” with O’Connor, who said he was going to charge her son with assault.,“I told her there was no other option,” O’Connor wrote in the report. “I showed her the image of the male (that security) had taken. She did not recognize the male.”,Benson said she’d speak to her son and call the officer back. However, he’d still not heard back after midnight, so he called Benson, who then told him she’d removed his cards “so her son would not worry about why the police were looking for him,” according to O’Connor’s report.,“She told me he was probably at one of the Aspen bars,” O’Connor reported. “I asked her if he had fake identification since he was 19. She told me, ‘No, the bars in Aspen allow people under 21 to come in if they don’t drink.’ I told her that was not the case. She told me that was what her son told her and I must be mistaken.”,O’Connor then left, but still had not heard anything by 12:50 a.m., so he returned to the hotel with an Aspen police sergeant. They knocked on Peters’ door again and received no answer, though they heard activity inside. Benson then came out into hallway and said her son wasn’t answering because he was afraid of the police, the report states.,The officers said they weren’t going anywhere until they spoke to her son, and Benson allegedly became “very evasive,” so the officer “shifted gears,” according to the report.,O’Connor then served Benson with a summons charging her with obstruction.,“I told Benson if her son did not come out I would have an officer waiting for them in the morning as they left for the airport,” O’Connor wrote in the report. “I told her he would miss his flight because he would be arrested, placed in handcuffs and taken to jail.”,Peters then came out of his room and told officers his lawyer told him not to talk to them. O’Connor, who reported that Peters matched the photo W Hotel security provided him of the alleged snowball-thrower, then served Peters with the summons for assault, which is the same as an arrest.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/teen-charged-with-assault-after-striking-woman-with-snowball-from-aspen-hotel-roof/,2022-03-25
Jason Auslander,Absent Indy Pass hostage-taker may be on hook for $2 million,"Though he is out of prison, the former real estate agent who held three young men hostage at gunpoint on Independence Pass nearly six years ago ignored a civil court bench trial Monday that could result in more than $2 million in damages against him.,Brolin McConnell, 36, initially corresponded with the 9th Judicial District court in the case but has not actively participated in the case since he was paroled from a Delta prison in January and allowed to move to Texas, said Aspen attorney Michael Fox.,“I’m a little chagrined Mr. McConnell is already out and on parole,” said District Judge John Neiley. “People get out of (prison) a lot sooner than we think they do.”,Fox asked Neiley to award Brian Buchanan, Mark Meredith and Blake Ramelb each $450,000 for pain and suffering and another $300,000 each because of permanent impairment inflicted by McConnell, a total of $2.25 million. Neiley said he would issue a ruling in the next couple of days.,“No amount of money is going to make Mark, Brian and Blake whole,” Fox said, noting that each victim would gladly pay $750,000 for the incident not to have occurred. “The pain and suffering these young men have endured is unimaginable.”,Buchanan and Meredith initially encountered McConnell’s stopped truck along , on the way to do some bouldering and possible camping. McConnell then pulled out two handguns and repeatedly threatened to kill them while shooting at a bird he thought was a surveillance drone and demanding $100 million.,Ramelb, who had recently had surgery on his foot, drove into the middle of the scene and also was taken hostage. McConnell later fired a bullet at his feet and another next to his head.,All three were able to eventually get away from McConnell, who was then arrested by police without further incident.,“Any of us could have been driving up Independence Pass that day,” Fox said. “We could have been the ones stopped by this person and had a gun pointed at our head.”,Each of the three men — who were all in their early to mid-20s when the incident occurred — testified Monday. All three thought they were going to die and have suffered extreme post-traumatic stress disorder that continues to have life-altering consequences today, Fox said.,McConnell, formerly of Colorado Springs, , to criminal attempt to commit first-degree kidnapping and felony menacing in December 2019 and , in March 2020, though he faced a maximum of 20 years behind bars.,He apologized to the victims at that time and said, “I’m not the same person (I was) prior to going insane.”,His lawyer at the time said McConnell was clearly suffering from mental illness during the hostage incident and “simply lost it that day.” Seldin made reference at the time to McConnell’s experiencing “paranoid delusions,” and said a 20-year sentence would only serve as retribution and that McConnell really needed consistent mental health treatment.,McConnell was given credit for the approximately 3½ years he spent in the Pitkin County Jail and served less than two years in Colorado prison before he was released on parole in January.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/absent-indy-pass-hostage-taker-may-be-on-hook-for-2-million/,2022-03-22
Ike Fredregill,Criminal extortion case against Silt man heads to jury trial in June,"A case against a Silt man accused of harassing an undocumented immigrant is scheduled for a jury trial following a motions hearing Friday.,Mark H. Aspiri, who allegedly threatened to report a undocumented immigrant if the individual didn’t pay Aspiri more than $1,000, is scheduled to appear in court for a pretrial conference June 14, and his jury trial is slated to begin June 22. , include ethnic intimidation and criminal extortion.,According to Ballotpedia, Aspiri was a 2014 Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Colorado for a brief time before dropping out.,Aspiri and his attorney Chip McCrory attended a virtual motions hearing Friday, during which 9th District Judge James Boyd ruled on motions for discovery and to suppress statements.,Glenwood Springs Police Department Det. Jeff Fain and Officer Alicia Hampton testified during the hearing on a motion to suppress statements.,Hampton testified she was dispatched Dec. 9, 2020, to speak with the victim and his translator, who alleged Aspiri threatened the victim during a call about missing wages. The conversation occurred over the phone, and Hampton said she followed up the allegations by contacting Aspiri and directing him not to contact the victim again. She didn’t recall if Aspiri acknowledged her directive, but told the court she advised Aspiri that he could be charged with harassment if he continued to contact the victim.,McCrory questioned Hampton about taking notes during the phone call, and where those notes might be included in the incident report. Hampton said she might have written down a phone number on a notepad or entered notes on an incident report, but she did not recall which.,On Dec. 10, 2020, Fain was working on patrol duties when he was also dispatched to speak over the phone with the victim and his translator, Fain testified.,The conversation was brief, but Fain learned the victim was in communication with two other people who had complaints about communications with Aspiri for not being paid for work completed, according to Fain’s testimony.,During the call, the victim claimed he did not know Aspiri, but Aspiri was demanding the victim pay him money or Aspiri would turn the victim into immigration, Fain said.,Fain said he followed the conversation with the victim by calling Aspiri, who allegedly denied calling the victim or threatening the victim. The detective said he also called additional numbers provided by the victim to speak with people familiar with the situation.,McCrory asked Fain about taking notes on the call. Fain said he did not have his notes readily available and could not guarantee he took notes, but if he did, they were likely written down in a notepad.,Fain added his notes were not requested by the District Attorney’s Office as part of the case against Aspiri.,Representing the DA’s Office, attorney Heidi Bauer told Boyd she filed a request for Fain’s note as a result of the Friday testimony.,Boyd ruled to deny the motion to suppress statements.,On motions of discovery, McCrory said his office did not receive recordings of the victim’s voicemails, which might have been provided to the police department. He also requested copies of the victim’s witnesses’ statements, copies of incident reports related to the case and any police recordings of conversation translations with the victim, who does not speak English, or non-English speaking witnesses.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/criminal-extortion-case-against-silt-man-heads-to-jury-trial-in-june/,2022-04-02
Jason Auslander,Victim testifies in trial of Basalt man charged with attempted sexual assault,"A 24-year-old woman who was cornered in the bathroom of a downtown Aspen bar by an intoxicated man last summer didn’t hesitate Wednesday when a prosecutor asked her what she thought about his intentions.,“He would’ve raped me,” she said.,The woman — a Washington D.C. resident and lifelong visitor to Aspen — was the first witness to testify Wednesday in the trial of Robert Marlow, a 41-year-old Basalt man charged with attempted sexual assault, false imprisonment and indecent exposure.,The victim had been out to dinner with a family friend the night of July 6 last year and ended up at Aspen Public House about 1 a.m. on July 7. She testified that she’d had two glasses of wine the entire evening and ordered water at Public House before heading to the bathroom about 15 minutes after arriving at the bar.,She said she first entered the unlocked women’s bathroom and saw a tall man — later identified as Marlow — standing inside with his pants unbuttoned. She said she immediately closed the door, apologized for the intrusion and decided to use the men’s room immediately opposite the women’s room because she thought it would be a similar one-toilet facility with a locking door.,When she entered the men’s room, however, she realized it wasn’t the exact same set-up as the women’s room, hesitated a moment and testified she felt maybe she shouldn’t be in there. At that point, the man who had been in the women’s room came “barging” into the men’s room and backed her up against the wall between a toilet stall and the sink, she said.,The man put his right arm up against the wall, blocking her from leaving, and with his left hand began pulling his pants and boxers down to his knees, she said. She testified that she saw his penis, but could not recall if it was flaccid or erect.,“I was more focused on getting out,” she said.,At that point, she began kicking and screaming at the top of her lungs, she said.,“I said, ‘Please don’t do this. Please let me go,’” she said, crying on the witness stand. “And he said, ‘You’re not going anywhere.’”,The woman testified that the scenario she was faced with had played out many times in her head as one of her greatest fears, and that she’d always told herself that if something like that happened she’d have 60-to-90 seconds to get out of it. In that “moment of clarity,” she said she began counting down from 60, then realized Marlow was much taller than her and that she could duck under his arm and run out of the bathroom, which she did.,A video played in court Wednesday — as well as at a , — showed Marlow sitting at a table near the Public House bathrooms and entering the bathroom area seconds before the woman walked downstairs from the bar area to the bathrooms. The 53-second video was not positioned to record what occurred inside the bathrooms, but the audio portion recorded her screaming, and the video caught her running out of the bathroom.,The woman said she’d never seen Marlow before in her life and did not recognize him sitting at the defense table when prosecutor Don Nottingham asked if he was in the courtroom Wednesday.,She said she did not call police that night and didn’t talk to a detective until about noon on July 7. She said she had never experienced such a “trauma” before, and that she initially thought that if she ignored what happened it would go away, though that quickly turned out not to be the case.,On cross-examination, public defender Scott Troxell brought up inconsistencies in the woman’s account of what happened that evening. She admitted she initially told police she spent the first night after the incident at her home when she actually stayed at the family friend’s house. She also told police at one point that she hadn’t seen Marlow’s penis, though she testified Wednesday she did see it and that the memory of seeing it came back to her.,During his opening statement, Troxell said Marlow was “blackout intoxicated” the night of the incident and also had been doing cocaine. However, he said Marlow’s reaction to the cocaine was not typical and that it had caused him to hallucinate, which he chalked up to “strange powders going around Aspen.”,“You will hear that he had a blank stare (on his face),” Troxell said. “There was something wrong with him.”,Regardless of what Marlow ingested, he has “very little recollection of that evening,” Troxell said.,Troxell said the victim clearly believed she was about to be raped but that what actually happened doesn’t equal attempted sexual assault with force under the law.,“I won’t ask you to believe nothing happened,” Troxell told jurors. “Something happened. I’d ask you to look at the evidence. It is not attempted sexual assault with force, even if that’s what (the victim) felt it was.”,Marlow’s trial — which is taking place in the basement of the former Aspen City Hall building while the Pitkin County Courthouse undergoes renovations — is scheduled to run through Monday.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/victim-testifies-in-trial-of-basalt-man-charged-with-attempted-sexual-assault/,2022-04-07
Jason Auslander,Chronic drunk driver arrested again on DUI charge at Aspen airport,"A Roaring Fork Valley man with at least six prior drunken-driving convictions was arrested again Monday at the Aspen-Pitkin County Airport and charged with felony DUI, according to court records.,Harve Hoff, 64, had to be pulled out of the backseat of his vehicle in front of the airport arrivals door by two Pitkin County sheriff’s deputies and handcuffed after refusing to cooperate, according to a warrantless arrest affidavit filed in Pitkin County District Court.,Emergency dispatchers were first alerted to Hoff about 3:30 p.m. Monday after a caller reported that he smelled like alcohol and had a history of alcohol problems, the affidavit states. The person Hoff was supposed to pick up at the airport told an airport operations employee that she didn’t feel safe getting in the car with him.,The airport employee reported that Hoff was sitting in the front seat of a white Lexus with Texas license plates, though he had moved to the backseat by the time a deputy arrived. Hoff refused to follow directions from the deputy and repeatedly asked the person he was picking up to drive away, according to the affidavit.,Hoff was argumentative, would not get out the car, declined to speak with the deputy and had slurred, “thick-tongued” speech. He also refused to perform roadside sobriety tests and became more agitated when the deputy informed him that he was going to be arrested for drunken driving because witnesses had seen him behind the wheel.,After another deputy arrived and helped drag Hoff out of the car, they transported him to the Pitkin County Jail. In addition to the six DUI convictions, Hoff also was the subject of several protection orders filed against him that forbid him from consuming alcohol or controlled substances as well as a suspended license.,Hoff, part of a longtime Pitkin County family whose latest address on file was in Glenwood Springs, has been arrested 17 times in the past 10 years by the Pitkin County Sheriff’s Office mostly for alcohol-related incidents, according to Sheriff’s Office records. He was charged Monday with felony DUI, driving with a suspended license, violating a protection order and violation of bail bonds conditions.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/chronic-drunk-driver-arrested-again-for-dui-at-aspen-airport/,2022-04-06

None,Western Slope groups advocate for funding for more wildlife crossings,"Northwest Colorado residents and wildlife conservation groups are among those advocating for more state funding for wildlife crossings proposed in Senate Bill 22-151 that currently is moving forward in the state legislature.,The bipartisan legislation called Safe Crossings for Colorado Wildlife and Motorists would provide additional funding for wildlife road crossing projects across the state.,The ,was up for discussion on Friday, in the State House of Representatives as the final step for approval.,The bill would create a Colorado Wildlife Safe Passages Fund for wildlife crossing projects on stretches of roads and highways with high rates of wildlife-vehicle collisions or where the ability of wildlife to move across the landscape has been hampered by high traffic volumes, explained Paige Singer, a conservation biologist with nonprofit Rocky Mountain Wild.,“Hunting, fishing and watchable wildlife contribute $5 billion in economic output in Colorado each year and support 40,000 jobs across the state,” the Colorado Wildlife Conservation Project wrote in a May 3 letter to the Colorado House Appropriations Committee.,“The $5 million allocation and the fund that would be established by Senate Bill 151 would begin to make travel through the state safer for residents, visitors and wildlife and would ensure that healthy, resilient wildlife populations and quality hunting opportunities continue to be part of the Colorado way of life,” the letter continued.,Routt County resident Gaspar Perricone, who serves as chair of the Colorado Wildlife Conservation Project, said he “is pleased at the commitment the state is making and hopes for continued investment in this ongoing effort.”,The fund would help advance projects identified in CDOT’s 10-year pipeline of projects with wildlife infrastructure components, as well as projects identified by the Colorado Wildlife and Transportation Alliance.,Perricone said a key benefit to the state funding would be to help leverage more federal funding.,“This is a great step in strengthening the landscape connectivity necessary to support a healthy wildlife population while reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions across the state,” Perricone said Thursday, May 5. “It’s good news for public safety and wildlife and hunting opportunities and the associated economic activity in the county.”,The section of U.S. Highway 40 stretching from east of Craig to Hayden is just one area of significant wildlife-vehicle collisions. That section is also on the state’s list as a priority for Northwest Colorado for developing funding strategies and future projects, said Elise Thatcher, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Transportation.,Area motorists and law enforcement officials also witness numerous wildlife-vehicle collisions on many sections of U.S. 40 throughout the Yampa Valley and up through Rabbit Ears Pass, as well as on other area roads., have killed bears and moose near Steamboat Springs several times within the past year.,Rocky Mountain Wild noted that law enforcement officials report an average of 4,000 wildlife-vehicle collisions annually in Colorado, though the number may be closer to 14,100 each year when estimating unrecorded collisions.,According to Rocky Mountain Wild, wildlife-vehicle collisions can have tragic consequences, including hundreds of human injuries and some fatalities, the death of thousands of animals, and an annual cost of approximately $80 million in property damage, emergency response, medical treatments and other costs. That figure does not include the value of lost wildlife — estimated at about $24 million — or the impact on the health of wildlife populations.,According to the CDOT Western Slope Wildlife Prioritization Study completed in 2019, Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials estimate that more mule deer are killed each year in wildlife-vehicle collisions on the Western Slope than from the annual hunter harvest.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/western-slope-groups-advocate-for-funding-for-more-wildlife-crossings/,2022-05-08
None,Jury finds Vail man not guilty of attempted murder,"The story of how Robert Fergus-Jean came to be charged with first-degree attempted murder, among other things, has been told and retold from various perspectives ,when Fergus-Jean fired six shots at his roommate and friend Stephen Darley through Darley’s closed bedroom door at their apartment in Vail, which Fergus-Jean and his attorneys claim was an act of self-defense.,It all ended just after 6 p.m. Thursday when a jury found Fergus-Jean to be not guilty of first-degree attempted murder, attempted manslaughter and first-degree assault, but convicted him on a few other, less severe, charges.,On Thursday morning, the prosecution and the defense presented their closing arguments.,Deputy District Attorney Amy Padden of the 5th Judicial District began her closing argument in the same way her fellow Deputy District Attorney, Johnny Lombardi, began his opening statement a week prior.,“Every gun tells a story, and what a story the two guns in this case have told,” Padden said.,“Guns don’t tell stories. People tell stories,” Fergus-Jean’s defense attorney, Jeffrey Pagliuca, shot back in his closing argument. “Mr. Darley is the king of storytellers in this case, and what a story he told.”,, the prosecution rested its case against Fergus-Jean on Wednesday afternoon, paving the way for the defense to begin calling additional witnesses, if desired.,Fergus-Jean chose to exercise his constitutional right to remain silent and did not testify. With no other witnesses to call, the defense rested its case and the presentation of evidence concluded.,When the jury left the room Wednesday, Pagliuca filed a motion with Chief Judge Paul R. Dunkelman, asking him to acquit Fergus-Jean on all counts brought against him. Pagliuca said the prosecution had failed to present sufficient evidence to prove the charges brought against his client but pointed to a few in particular.,Chief Judge Dunkelman denied Pagliuca’s motions for acquittal on all charges except for part of a criminal mischief charge and, more importantly, the first-degree attempted murder charge brought against Fergus-Jean regarding Michael Piro.,When Fergus-Jean fired his gun at Darley back in December of 2020, one of the six bullets traveled through Darley’s bedroom wall and into an adjoining apartment where Piro lay sleeping in his bed. The bullet traveled just 3 feet to the left and 2 feet above Piro’s head, according to police testimony.,This led the District Attorney’s Office to charge Fergus-Jean with a second count of first-degree attempted murder on the basis of “extreme indifference” under Colorado state statute.,The elements of this charge stipulate that someone knowingly acted in a way that created a grave risk of death by showing extreme indifference to the value of human life, Dunkelman said. He agreed that the prosecution did not present sufficient evidence to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Fergus-Jean knew there was someone in that room that he was endangering when he chose to fire his gun.,The final charges submitted to the jury Thursday morning included two misdemeanor counts of prohibited use of a weapon, illegal discharge of a firearm (a Class 5 felony) and misdemeanor criminal mischief.,The more severe charges presented to the jury regarding Darley as an alleged victim were first-degree assault (a Class 3 felony), criminal attempt to commit murder in the first degree “after deliberation” and with the “intent to kill” (a Class 2 felony) and criminal attempt to commit reckless manslaughter (a Class 4 felony).,Regarding Piro, the final charges presented to the jury were reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor, and a reduced charge of criminal attempt to commit reckless manslaughter.,This change represents a substantial reduction in Fergus-Jean’s maximum potential sentence as first-degree attempted murder can carry a sentence of up to 48 years in prison while attempted manslaughter carries a sentence of two to six years in prison.,Two other charges brought against Fergus-Jean — tampering with physical evidence and possession of a controlled substance, both Class 6 felonies — were severed from this particular case but can be tried separately if the District Attorney’s Office decides to do so.,“Every gun tells a story, and what a story the two guns in this case have told,” Padden said as she began her closing argument Thursday. “First is the story of this Smith and Weston. This gun was owned by Mr. Darley, one of the victims in this case. This gun was not aimed at anybody, it was never discharged.”,Darley used the gun as “an act of deterrence,” he said, to get Fergus-Jean to leave him alone when the two began to argue that night. Fergus-Jean was the “antagonizing aggressor,” punching, shoving and threatening Darley and refusing to leave Darley’s room until he pulled out the gun to protect himself, Padden said.,Fergus-Jean’s gun, on the other hand, “is a very different story to tell,” she said, holding up the gun. That .45-caliber Kimber 1911 semi-automatic handgun was fired six times after Fergus-Jean ran to his room to retrieve it and shot at Darley through his closed bedroom door.,Fergus-Jean showed no regard for Darley’s safety, she said. If he was only acting in self-defense, why didn’t he get to safety and then call 911 to get medical attention for Darley?,Whether Darley’s bedroom door was open or closed when Fergus-Jean fired those six shots doesn’t really matter, Pagliuca said. At the end of the day, it was Darley who brandished his pistol while he was drunk, high and angry, and Fergus-Jean had reason to fear for his life either way, he said.,Fergus-Jean did care about Darley’s safety, Pagliuca said, even going so far as to help him tend to his wounds once he was sure that both of their guns were down, according to his interview with police.,“Guns don’t tell stories,” Pagliuca said, but he speculated about what Darley’s gun might say if it could tell the story of that night.,Darley testified that, just before 12:30 a.m., he was so frightened by an increasing level of aggression coming from Fergus-Jean that he took two short videos of their interactions on his cellphone, which ,. Darley told police that this led him to go to his room to remove himself, but Fergus-Jean refused to leave and that is when things took a turn for the worse.,Pagliuca suggested another version of this story. Darley failed to tell police that he took his dog outside for a walk at 12:47 a.m. that night, returning at 12:50 a.m. just minutes before the shooting, according to surveillance footage. Why didn’t Darley mention this to police?,“He’s not going out to the car to walk his dog; he’s going out to that car to get his gun,” Pagliuca said. Darley testified that he sometimes keeps his gun in his car, and Pagliuca said this would explain why he left this detail out, why Darley told Fergus-Jean they didn’t need to call the police and why he minimized the medical attention that he needed after being shot.,“He knows why this happened, he knows he instigated this, and he knows that he’s lucky he didn’t kill Mr. Fergus-Jean because he would be sitting over here,” Pagliuca said, pointing to where Fergus-Jean was sitting at the defense table.,Padden argued that it was Fergus-Jean’s story that was not credible.,In multiple statements, Fergus-Jean said that Darley got his gun and pointed it upward before starting to “come around” toward Fergus-Jean, often demonstrating a predominately upwards motion for police. It wasn’t until the last statement Padden highlighted that Fergus-Jean said — and showed — that Darley had actually pointed the gun at him.,For the jury to find that Fergus-Jean acted in self-defense that night, the evidence would need to show that Fergus-Jean fired those shots to defend himself against what he “reasonably believed” to be unlawful use of force by another person, Padden said.,Darley took his dog outside and returned to the apartment just two minutes before the shooting, she said, using the defense’s argument against them.,“In less than two minutes, was it reasonable for this defendant to believe that there was an imminent use of force coming from Mr. Darley,” Padden asked, or is it more reasonable that Darley just wanted Fergus-Jean to get out of his room so he could go to sleep?,“If (Darley) was really going to shoot Mr. Fergus-Jean, why would he tell Mr. Fergus-Jean to get out of his room and then shut the door behind him?” she said.,“Nitpicking Robert’s statement is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt,” Pagliuca said. Reasonable doubt is legally defined as anything that would “cause reasonable people to hesitate.”,“Let’s talk about the reasons to hesitate in this case,” he said.,The Vail Police Department did not do what it should have done to check out Darley’s side of the story, even though Darley had “a serious credibility problem,” Pagliuca argued. Darley had a blood alcohol content of 0.195 and admitted to smoking marijuana and taking hallucinogenic mushrooms.,Police should have asked for all the surveillance footage of the Lion’s Ridge apartment building from that night to check up on what Darley was doing, Pagliuca said. Police did not search Darley’s phone or test his urine as they did with Fergus-Jean. Detectives only conducted two interviews with him.,In her closing statement, Padden played a video clip of Fergus-Jean’s Dec. 30 police interview in which he said, “I would have done everything the same.”,We don’t get do-overs in life, Padden said, but it is alarming that, if given one, Fergus-Jean said he would not run, he would not hide with his gun or perhaps fire a warning shot — he would do everything the same.,To convict Fergus-Jean on the first-degree attempted murder charge brought in relation to Darley, the prosecution had to show that Fergus-Jean had “an intent to kill,” she said.,So, what was Fergus-Jean’s intent? Padden played another video clip from the police interview in which Fergus-Jean responds to this question by saying “Yes, given the scenario, it was my intent to target (Darley).”,“That is not self-defense, that is attempted murder,” Padden said at the conclusion of her statement.,All of the choices that Fergus-Jean was faced with in that moment were bad, Pagliuca said. “The choice that Robert took here saved his life.”,With that, the case was turned over to a 12-member jury made up of Eagle County residents.,After more than five hours of waiting, Fergus-Jean and his attorneys were notified that the jury had reached a verdict just after 6 p.m Thursday.,The jury found Fergus-Jean to be not guilty of the three most severe charges brought against him: first-degree attempted murder (a Class 2 felony), first-degree assault (a Class 3 felony) and attempt to commit reckless manslaughter (a Class 4 felony).,They found him guilty of two misdemeanor counts of prohibited use of a weapon, illegal discharge of a firearm (a Class 5 felony) and misdemeanor criminal mischief. The Class 5 felony, his only felony conviction, is punishable by one to three years in prison and $1,000 to $100,000 in fines.,Fergus-Jean’s sentence will be decided by Chief Judge Dunkelman in a hearing set for the afternoon of May 11.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/jury-finds-vail-man-not-guilty-of-attempted-murder/,2022-03-19
None,Road Trip Report: The Best Spring Skiing In The West,"After a , to Taos, New Mexico, for the Aspen Times Weekly’s , last year, my guy and I decided to make checking out a new resort every spring an annual tradition — one that forgoes airfare in favor of the freedom that comes with traveling on the open road.,With two big birthday trips — my mother’s in Saratoga, Wyoming, and best friend’s in Big Sky, Montana — on the books in March and April, we fortuitously found ourselves mapping a (near) perfect circle of spring skiing in the Rocky Mountains.,Starting and ending at our Snowmass Village home, we split up the route between two separate trips, but it’s definitely doable within one week. Plus, each destination — with the exception of The Lodge & Spa at Brush Creek Ranch, which has its own private cat-served ski area — is included on the , pass (from $539 for 2022-23).,How lucky are we to have such easy, drivable access to the best slopes in the West that the rest of the world seeks out?,This spring’s solid series of snowstorms brought more late-breaking powder days than usual. Matched with fewer crowds, sunshine-soaked patio parties and a schedule of live music along the way, our road trip(s) resulted in the ultimate wind down of the 2021-22 ski season.,And now that the lifts have stopped spinning until next winter, there’s no better time to plan ahead for the next one, which will surely help battle the offseason blues.,Unlike one fellow columnist who lives here, but loves to write about how much he , Snowmass, it’s my favorite mountain in the world (although I might be biased since choosing it as my forever backyard). Snowmass goes as big as its terrain (3,342 skiable acres) for spring with a jam-packed calendar of annual festivities ranging from a rowdy St. Patrick’s Day Celebration and the NASTAR National Championships to the Bud Light Mountain Challenge and an epic end-of-season “Surf & Snow Beach Party” (pond skim included) at Elk Camp. ,Whether you’re a resident or visitor, the LEED Gold-Certified Viceroy Snowmass remains the perfect pick for a staycation or vacation since opening its doors in 2009. Since then, the haute hideaway has the best ski-in/ski- out access in town with its own lift on Assay Hill, a Richard Sandoval restaurant, year-round pool and hot tub patio with service from its second dining outpost Nest Bar & Grill, a coffee-shop and most- importantly, a 7,000-square-foot Jean-Michel Gathy-designed spa. This season, Viceroy Snowmass debuted the “Friends On A Powder Day” package including a private group powder tour with a poolside cabana après experience and also introduced “Vi,” a 5-month- old Bernese Mountain Dog as its official hotel dog, who will welcomes guests during a pet- friendly “Yappy Hour” every afternoon and is always happy to head out with guests for walks and hikes. ,It’s still somewhat of a secret that you have to ski to eat the best Italian cuisine in town (Aspen included) atop Sam’s Knob. Save the sit-down lunch (reservations required) for the end of your day, so you can over-indulge on authentic Sicilian-inspired fare from fresh antipasti and daily-baked bread to housemade pastas and “The Grandma Style” pizza prepared in the live-action kitchen, which all pairs best with a classic Negroni Spritz. ,Known for having Utah’s longest winter season (November through May), Snowbird is a spring skiing dream with a “price meltdown on the mountain” through its special “Stay & Ski” package (two nights lodging and discounted lift tickets; 2023 TBA) every April. This year, “the Bird” celebrated its 50th anniversary season, but its old soul — and its tram — has remained unchanged. But come summer, two new cabins with floor-to-ceiling windows, glass floor panels and a rooftop balcony(!) will arrive to whisk guests to and from Hidden Peak (10,992 feet) and into the future. Snowbird also hosts a lively lineup of spring concerts at the Plaza Deck through the end of the season, which is where all the après action happens. ,Powder magazine (RIP) once called Snowbird’s only luxury lodge “that big concrete hotel,” but after a $35 million renovation completed in 2019, The Cliff Lodge has come a long way. As the anchor of the resort base, staying at The Cliff Lodge is as close to the tram as you can get while also within walking distance to Snowbird’s pedestrian village. After shredding all day, head straight for the legendary outdoor pool and hot tubs. For breakfast, lunch and dinner there are two on-site options: The Aerie Restaurant and Lounge and The Atrium. ,Treat yourself (and your sore ski legs) at The Cliff Spa, conveniently located on the rooftop of The Cliff Hotel, which also offers a yoga studio, fitness center and additional pool and hot tub complex. For après ski bliss, book one of the Cliff Spa Journeys like The Refresher (140 minutes) that includes a 60-minute Signature Massage, Great Salt Lake Body Polish and Signature Pedicure) — just one of more than 30 treatments on the menu. ,Another iconic ski resort, another iconic tram. Boarding the Aerial Tram (aka “Big Red”) almost instantly puts a knot in your stomach as it swiftly ascends up more than 4,000 feet in 12 minutes to the summit (10,927 feet) where you can take in 360-degree views of the staggering Tetons and surrounding ranges. Stopping inside Corbet’s Cabin (named in honor of mountaineer Barry Corbet who spotted his namesake run “Corbet’s Couloir” just below it in 1960) for a famous waffle is a must before choosing your line down Rendezvous Mountain. Beyond skiing some of the steepest terrain in the world, catch a concert — or a few — during the annual Jackson Hole Rendezvous Spring Festival every April. This season’s headliners included ski town favorites The Wailers, Brett Dennen and Ben Harper & The Innocent Criminals along with the Cold War Kids and Fitz & The Tantrums. ,Although staying in historic downtown Jackson entails a 20-minute commute to the slopes of Jackson Hole, experiencing its Old West charm is well worth sacrificing ski-in/ski-out status. Check into the sophisticated yet approachable Hotel Jackson — just steps from Town Square with arches on each corner made of shed antlers from the nearby National Elk Refuge. This family- operated “passion project” opened in 2015 and has already earned four-star status for its 58 mountain modern guest rooms and six (soon-to-be nine) suites. An expansion project is currently underway, which when complete, will also feature a full- service spa, new retail store and a rooftop restaurant with a lounge. And don’t miss dinner downstairs at FIGS — it’s a Limelight-esque community gathering space off the lobby featuring Lebanese-inspired cuisine as an ode to owner Jim Darwiche’s wife, Safaa. ,No trip to Jackson is complete without bellying — er, saddling up — to the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar. Established in 1938 on Town Square the landmark, which has guests hop on real horse saddles instead of bar stools, still stands as the best watering hole and live country music venue in the West. ,Self-proclaimed as “the biggest skiing in America,” Big Sky Resort lives up to its name with a massive mountain totaling 5,800 skiable acres, estimated to give each guest 2 whole acres to themselves. Thanks to its Northern exposure and wild wind patterns, the best snow often arrives later in the season with plenty of terrain open through closing day to explore. For experts only, the iconic Lone Peak gondola — built in 1995 — is readying for a replacement this summer as part of “Big Sky 2025” ,. In addition to the already up-and-running state-of-the-art Swift Current 6 (the fastest chairlift in the U.S. with heated seats and a dome) will boast a base-to-summit lift network and new top-of-the- mountain experience at 11,167 feet. While Big Sky’s Mountain Village is also a work-in-progress, there’s still a plethora of dining options and après-ski hangouts. And stay tuned for a schedule announcement for the 15th annual Big Sky Big Grass music festival (2023 TBA), which this spring welcomed acts from the Drew Emmitt Band and Keller Williams to The Travelin’ McCourys and Sam Bush. ,After opening its doors in December, the Montage Big Sky has already earned , accolades for the longtime sleepy ski town (Big Sky Resort originally opened in 1973). As the area’s first luxury resort experience, Montage Hotels & Resorts brings its signature five-star service slopeside, offering ski-in/ski-out access with valet and locker room, a 10,000-square-foot spa (also a first for Big Sky), recreation lounge with a bowling alley, indoor lap pool, family swimming pool and fitness center, plus six different dining venues inspired by Montana’s rich agricultural heritage. Conceptualized by Hart Howerton with interiors by BraytonHughes Design Studios, the aesthetic is a contemporary take on the classic North American lodge featuring 139 guest rooms, suites, and residences (from two to six bedrooms) — each curated with a palette of timeless, regionally- sourced raw materials and accented with artwork from local artists. ,Take a ski break to take a hike up to Ousel Falls — a short drive from Big Sky, this easy 1.6 mile roundtrip trek is open year-round (snow boots with traction are recommended during the winter). After meandering the South and West Forks of the Gallatin River, a gorgeous waterfall with an overlook, pool and picnic area awaits for a moment of zen. ,Save the last stop for a once-in-a- lifetime ski day (or few) on your very own powder playground. Opened in 2019 as part of the ultra-exclusive Brush Creek Ranch compound, Green Mountain is supremely secluded on a parcel of private property amid Medicine Bow National Forest and BLM land encompassing 620 skiable acres. Solely serviced by three sparkling, bright red PistenBully snowcats, a maximum of just 18 guests per day are shuttled up and down the slopes with personal guides paired to every group for fresh tracks through double-diamond glades and untouched corduroy on every turn. When a warm-up or boot break is needed, yurts decked out with fireplaces and cushy leather couches are scattered across the mountain with a gourmet lunch prepared inside “Pat’s Porch,” which also provides breathtaking views of the singular, stunning south-central Wyoming landscape. ,When I learned that the “No. 1 Resort Hotel in the West” (and “No. 6 in the U.S.”) according to Travel + Leisure magazine’s , survey was less than a five-hour drive from Snowmass, I booked it ASAP to celebrate my mother’s birthday — a more-than-worthy splurge after multiple canceled trips over the pandemic. Set in total solitude on a 30,000-acre working cattle ranch, The Lodge & Spa at Brush Creek Ranch was the ultimate escape to live out an authentic Western choose- your-own adventure. You’ll also have a most memorable dinner at the grand Cheyenne Club restaurant — American Wagyu beef right off the ranch takes center stage here paired with wine from its 40,000-bottle Brush Creek Cellar or cocktails from the Spirit Vault. ,Beyond skiing at Green Mountain, there is an extensive menu of winter activities, but allocate an afternoon to experience the epic culinary program. At this seed-to-table epicurean destination on the property, you can try your hand at cheesemaking in the Creamery, baking with executive pastry chef Keisha Sanderson or take a tour with Greenhouse director Serge Boon, who’ll let you sample produce straight from the vine.

None,"Artificial intelligence tapped to fight Colorado, Western U.S. wildfires","DENVER — With wildfires becoming bigger and more destructive as the West dries out and heats up, agencies and officials tasked with preventing and battling the blazes could soon have a new tool to add to their arsenal of prescribed burns, pick axes, chain saws and aircraft.,The high-tech help could come by way of an area not normally associated with fighting wildfires: artificial intelligence. And space.,Lockheed Martin Space, based in Jefferson County, is tapping decades of experience of managing satellites, exploring space and providing information for the U.S. military to offer more accurate data quicker to ground crews. They are talking to the U.S. Forest Service, university researchers and a Colorado state agency about how their their technology could help.,By generating more timely information about on-the-ground conditions and running computer programs to process massive amounts of data, Lockheed Martin representatives say they can map fire perimeters in minutes rather than the hours it can take now. They say the artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning the company has applied to military use can enhance predictions about a fire’s direction and speed.,“The scenario that wildland fire operators and commanders work in is very similar to that of the organizations and folks who defend our homeland and allies. It’s a dynamic environment across multiple activities and responsibilities,” said Dan Lordan, senior manager for AI integration at Lockheed Martin’s Artificial Intelligence Center.,Lockheed Martin aims to use its technology developed over years in other areas to reduce the time it takes to gather information and make decisions about wildfires, said Rich Carter, business development director for Lockheed Martin Space’s Mission Solutions.,“The quicker you can react, hopefully then you can contain the fire faster and protect people’s properties and lives,” Carter said.,The concept of a regular fire season has all but vanished as drought and warmer temperatures make Western lands ripe for ignition. At the end of December, the Marshall Fire burned 991 homes and killed two people in Boulder County. The Denver area just experienced its third driest-ever April with only 0.06 of an inch of moisture, according to the National Weather Service.,Colorado had the highest number of fire-weather alerts in April of any April in the past 15 years. Crews have quickly contained wind-driven fires that forced evacuations along the Front Range and on the Eastern Plains. But six families in Monte Vista lost their homes in April when a fire burned part of the southern Colorado town.,Since 2014, the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control has flown planes equipped with infrared and color sensors to detect wildfires and provide the most up-to-date information possible to crews on the ground. The onboard equipment is integrated with the Colorado Wildfire Information System, a database that provides images and details to local fire managers.,“Last year, we found almost 200 new fires that nobody knew anything about,” said Bruce Dikken, unit chief for the agency’s multi-mission aircraft program. “I don’t know if any of those 200 fires would have become big fires. I know they didn’t become big fires, because we found them.”,When the two Pilatus PC-12 airplanes began flying in 2014, Colorado was the only state with such a program conveying the information “in near real time,” Dikken said. Lockheed Martin representatives have spent time in the air on the planes recently to see if its AI can speed up the process.,“We don’t find every single fire that we fly over, and it can certainly be faster if we could employ some kind of technology that might, for instance, automatically draw the fire perimeter,” Dikken said. “Right now, it’s very much a manual process.”,Something like the 2020 Cameron Peak fire, which at 208,663 acres is Colorado’s largest wildfire, could take hours to map, Dikken said.,And often the people on the planes are tracking several fires at the same time. Dikken said the faster they can collect and process the data on a fire’s perimeter, the faster they can move to the next fire. If it takes a couple of hours to map a fire, “what I drew at the beginning may be a little bit different now,” he said.,Lordan said Lockheed Martin engineers who have flown with the state crews, using the video and images gathered on the flights, have been able to produce fire maps in as little as 15 minutes.,The company has talked to the state about possibly carrying an additional computer that could help “crunch all that information” and transmit the map of the fire while still in flight to crews on the ground, Dikken said. The agency is waiting to hear the results of Lockheed Martin’s experiences aboard the aircraft and how the AI might help the state, he added.,The company is also talking to researchers at the U.S. Forest Service Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory in Montana. Mark Finney, a research forester, said it’s early in discussions with Lockheed Martin.,“They have a strong interest in applying their skills and capabilities to the wildland fire problem, and I think that would be welcome,” Finney said.,The lab in Missoula has been involved in fire research since 1960 and developed most of the fire-management tools used for operations and planning, Finney said. “We’re pretty well situated to understand where new things and capabilities might be of use in the future and some of these things certainly might be.”,However, Lockheed Martin is focused on technology and that’s “not really been where the most effective use of our efforts would be,” Finney said.,“Prevention and mitigation and preemptive kind of management activities are where the great opportunities are to change the trajectory we’re on,” Finney said. “Improving reactive management is unlikely to yield huge benefits because the underlying source of the problem is the fuel structure across large landscapes as well as climate change.”,Logging and prescribed burns, or fires started under controlled conditions, are some of the management practices used to get rid of fuel sources or create a more diverse landscape. But those methods have sometimes met resistance, Finney said.,As bad as the Cameron Peak Fire was, Finney said the prescribed burns the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests did through the years blunted the blaze’s intensity and changed the flames’ movement in spots.,“Unfortunately, they hadn’t had time to finish their planned work,” Finney said.,Lordan said the value of artificial intelligence, whether in preventing fires or responding to a fire, is producing accurate and timely information for fire managers, what he called “actionable intelligence.”,One example, Lordan said, is information gathered and managed by federal agencies on the types and conditions of vegetation across the country. He said updates are done every two to three years. Lockheed Martin uses data from satellites managed by the European Space Agency that updates the information about every five days.,Lockheed is working with Nvidia, a California software company, to produce a digital simulation of a wildfire based on an area’s topography, condition of the vegetation, wind and weather to help forecast where and how it will burn.

Shelby Reardon,Veterinarian’s report details incomplete vaccinations at Colorado facility where 94 horses died,"The Bureau of Land Management suspects equine influenza virus H3N8, a virus common among wild and domestic horses, has caused the deaths of 94 horses since April 23 at a Cañon City holding facility.,There are more than 2,500 wild horses at the facility, including most of the horses gathered from the ,, but the illness is mostly spreading among horses captured from the West Douglas Herd Area, 5 miles south of Rangely, according to a ,on Thursday, April 28.,The release said polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory test results from two laboratories found the virus in several horses.,A ,on Thursday noted that while the pneumonia-like illness has been deadly for the West Douglas horses, symptoms have been mild among other horses at the facility.,Kane’s report also stated that the West Douglas horses were partially vaccinated or unvaccinated, which could be a factor in the spread of the illness. He said the initial illness arose five to 10 days after a group of 50 horses received their first vaccinations and appeared first and most severely in that same group of horses.,The West Douglas horses were captured in early August 2021 and should have been vaccinated shortly thereafter, according to BLM Colorado Spokesperson Steven Hall.,“Part of our review of what happened in this situation, is to determine why these horses hadn’t been vaccinated,” Hall said. “Was there an issue with resources? Was there with a number of horses at the facility? Was there an issue with COVID? We’re trying to determine what the factors were that led to these horses not being vaccinated.”,The BLM website states that “vaccines for adult horses and burros are administered and boostered as soon as possible after the animals arrive at a corral facility. It is a race against time to build immunity by vaccination while the animals are increasingly exposed to these viruses and bacteria in their new environment. Unfortunately, the respiratory diseases (flu, rhino and strangles) are highly contagious and difficult to control through vaccination alone. The vaccines may help limit how quickly and severely the illness spreads in a group setting.”,Kane’s report also suggested the West Douglas horses could have been compromised by smoke from the Oil Springs Fire, which burned 12,613 acres in the summer of 2021, including much of the herd’s range.,Thursday’s news release said 95 horses have died from the illness, but the death of a foal on April 18 has been deemed unrelated. As of Friday, April 29, Hall said there have been no additional deaths since Thursday.,The ,, which has sharply criticized the deaths, is calling on Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and state and federal policymakers to halt all wild horse roundups until the Cañon City investigation is complete.,“The suspension of roundups is imperative,” the advocacy group said in a news release on Friday, adding that a roundup is scheduled this summer for the Piceance-East Douglas herd outside of Meeker.,The outbreak has also ,.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/veterinarians-report-details-incomplete-vaccinations-at-colorado-facility-where-94-horses-died/,2022-05-03
Scott Miller,CORE Act has an important meeting set for Tuesday,"The Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act — better known as the CORE Act — has been more than a decade in the making. It might, just might, pass a crucial milestone this week.,The bill, which would protect more than 400,000 acres across the Colorado Rockies through a combination of new designated wilderness areas, recreation management and conservation areas, has passed four times through the U.S. House of Representatives. It has yet to pass muster with the U.S. Senate.,The bill this week is set for a committee hearing and possible vote by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Sen. John Hickenlooper is a member of that committee. Tuesday’s meeting is the farthest yet the bill has made it through the process. If the bill passes out of the committee, it will head to a floor vote. If the Senate passes the bill, it will head to the desk of President Joe Biden, who has said he will sign the bill into law.,A group of bill sponsors and supporters Monday held a virtual meeting to talk about the bill and its possible impacts.,Sen. Michael Bennet, who has championed the act for more than a decade, said the bill could be “one of the most meaningful” pieces of public lands legislation for Colorado in the past 25 years. Bennet noted that the bill has been built from the local level, and has support from Democrats, Republicans and independents. Supporters also include environmental, recreational and business interests, including, Bennet said, “an operating silver mine in Ouray County.”,The bill’s major Eagle County impact would be the creation of the nation’s first-ever “national historic landscape” at Camp Hale, where the 10th Mountain Division trained during World War II.,Pitkin County Commissioner Greg Poschman is the son of a 10th Mountain Division veteran. Poschman said the CORE Act could show those still alive from the unit’s first days that “we still have lessons to learn” from that generation.,Poschman said John Tripp, who will turn 103 this year, wants to see the bill passed, not only for the Camp Hale designation, but also for the future of the Thompson Divide.,The bill is a big deal for those in the Thompson Divide area, an alpine area comprising pieces of Pitkin, Gunnison and Garfield counties. That area has long been subject to pressures from drilling, mining, agricultural and environmental interests.,Carbondale rancher Bill Fales said the bill is “vitally” important to the area, and can provide some certainty about the area’s future.,Bennet noted that the bill’s language could add roughly 19,000 acres to the Thompson Divide area, and could prevent opening a mine near Crested Butte. But, he added, the bill could also clear a path for a land exchange for the mine property.,More than half of the CORE Act involves land in Gunnison County. Gunnison County Commissioner Jonathan Houck said the bill’s language began in local coffee shops and elsewhere, and was driven by concerns about balancing recreation, industry and preservation.,San Miguel County Commissioner Hilary Cooper noted that the bill is more important in the wake of large increases in public land use.,While the bill has broad support in this region, Bennet said the lack of action at the federal level shows the “dysfunction” in the nation’s Capitol.,Bennet noted there are senators with “an ideological opposition” to putting new restrictions or modifying use on public lands.,But, Hickenlooper said, he doesn’t see anything “insolvable” about moving the bill along this time.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/core-act-has-an-important-meeting-set-for-tuesday/,2022-05-03
None,Breckenridge’s Buy-Down program already at half of its 2022 goal,"The town of Breckenridge’s Buy-Down Program has reached half of its 2022 goal, meaning that the town has bought at least a dozen homes to sell back to the local workforce.,Corrie Burr, the housing program manager for the town, said via email Thursday that as of April 28, 13 properties were purchased to sell back to community members. She added that the team’s relationships with local real estate agents has helped in reaching this portion of 2022’s goal.,In Breckenridge’s ,, housing officials purchase homes for sale, place a local workforce restriction on the property and sell the home at a reduced price. This year, the goal was 24 homes — more than double what was bought last year. Under Housing Helps, another program offered by the town, the Town pays owners, buyers, sellers — including local businesses and investors — to accept a deed restriction on homes that are currently unrestricted. Burr told the Town Council on Tuesday that Housing Helps has had a slower start to 2022.,“We have a couple of new applications that we’re working through, connecting with some people that just are on the fence, but it’s strange. When Buy-Downs go up, Housing Helps goes down,” she told the Town Council. “They seem to shift back and forth, which is good for us. But you know, we’d like to see both of those programs higher, but we all know the prices of properties right now are really high.”,Because of the housing market, the average cost for a buy down has increased 154% from 2019 to 2021. According to an update to the Town Council,,“We need to keep buying what becomes available and is accepted (and) continue to focus on locations that have predominantly been locals (Gold Camp, Val d’Isere, Ptarmigan, Edelweiss, etc),” the update reads. “The Committee understands we need to continue to buy properties, take a bigger hit and get it into an affordable range with an appreciation cap — not focusing on size or number of bedrooms, just where locals can live.”,Earlier this year, Breckenridge Town Council gave its approval of the Five-Year Housing Blueprint, which will invest , for workforce housing — including programs like Housing Helps and Buy Downs. This is estimated to bring in over 900 units, and among those projects is ,, which is an extension of Alta Verde, an affordable housing project.,Town Council approved an increase of the project’s long-term loan by $1.27 million to help with sustainable energy improvements from Alta Verde I. Kimball Crangle, the Colorado Market President for developer Gorman and Company, said Alta Verde is successfully designed to be net zero, but with improvements during Phase 2’s development, the goal is to minimize energy consumption before having to offset it. Specifically, most of this will go toward photovoltaic panels — or panels that convert thermal energy into electricity — onto Alta Verde II’s buildings, which will be twice the size of Alta Verde I’s solar farm.,“I think we’re all getting smarter about climate change and realizing that one of the big goals is not just to offset what we use, but to actually reduce what we’re using in the first place to reduce the demand on the system, which just has all sorts of other benefits,” Crangle said.,Crangle said tenants as a whole will pay about $140,000 less on electricity in total because demand is so reduced, and over 10 years, savings will be $1.4 million and over 20 years, it’s $2.8 million. Groundbreaking for Alta Verde II could be any time in July or August.,“We’re really setting a bar here, and I do believe in what we’re doing,” Crangle said. “It’s just It comes with a price tag.”",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/breckenridges-buy-down-program-already-at-half-of-its-2022-goal/,2022-05-02
None,These four states already have universal preschool: What can Colorado learn from them?,"When Colorado launches free preschool for 4-year-olds in 2023, it will join a half dozen other states that already offer universal preschool.,All of them have encountered the same tricky task Colorado leaders now face as they try to knit together a disparate patchwork of public and private preschools into an equitable and high-quality statewide system. We’ll take a look at some of the lessons learned in four states: Florida, Oklahoma, Vermont, and Wisconsin.,Some, like Oklahoma, have offered the program for decades, while others, like Vermont — one of the few places to offer free preschool to all 3- and 4-year-olds — have joined the club more recently. Wisconsin officials said they don’t consider their preschool program universal because school districts don’t have to offer the state-funded classes, though 99% do.,Colorado’s universal preschool program will offer 10 hours a week to all 4-year-olds, with children who have higher needs eligible for more. Funding will come from Colorado’s existing state-funded preschool program, which is for children from low-income families, or who have language delays, or other risk factors, and proceeds from a voter-approved nicotine tax.,Advocates in the four states cited ongoing challenges in everything from ensuring high-quality offerings to making part-day preschool work for families, but they also said the programs are generally popular. In all four states, at least 70% of 4-year-olds participated prior to the pandemic.,Sherry Carlson, chief program officer at the Vermont advocacy group, Let’s Grow Kids, said the state’s system is not perfect, but “usage is an indication that we’re on the right track.”,Colorado’s plan to offer 10 hours of preschool a week to most children is similar to preschool programs in states like Florida, Vermont, and Wisconsin. The problem is that half-day programs don’t work for a lot of families.,Professor Beth Graue, director of the Center for Research on Early Childhood Education at the University of Wisconsin Madison, studied Wisconsin parents’ preschool choices and found that many declined to enroll in the program because of the schedule.,“The half-day format is a nightmare for at least a third of all the parents we surveyed,” she said. “It’s curious to me in today’s day and age that people imagine that a half day would work.“,When universal preschool originally launched in Florida, the vision was to offer both a 3-hour and a 6-hour preschool day, but there was never enough funding for the longer day, said Madeleine Thakur, president of the advocacy group, The Children’s Movement of Florida. Some schools — those that receive federal funds for low-income students —  cover the extra cost of full-day preschool for some students, but the coveted spots are in short supply.,In Vermont, momentum had been growing to increase the number of state-funded preschool hours beyond the current 10 a week, but the pandemic derailed that discussion, said Carlson.,“There is a lot of agreement, particularly among working families and schools, that more time would be better,” she said.,The four states profiled have various requirements for universal preschool teachers — Oklahoma and Wisconsin require them to have bachelor’s degrees, while Florida does not. Vermont is something of a hybrid — requiring bachelor’s degrees for universal preschool teachers in public school settings, but not for all teachers in private settings.,These differences reflect both ongoing national debate about whether teachers with four-year college degrees provide better preschool experiences than those without, and the reality that such requirements pose a major financial barrier in light of the field’s low pay.,The National Institute for Early Education Research, which ranks states annually on preschool access and funding, includes bachelor’s degree requirements among 10 benchmarks showing whether states have key quality standards in place. Experts say preschool can produce short- and long-term benefits for kids, but only if it’s high quality.,Colorado’s existing preschool program doesn’t require bachelor’s degrees and meets only four of the institute’s 10 benchmarks.,Carlson, who estimated that 60% of Vermont’s universal preschoolers are served in private settings, said the more lenient degree requirements for those classrooms was one of the concessions made when the program began. The state has put money toward helping preschool teachers further their education, but more needs to be done, she said.,Carlson’s advice to Colorado: “Be willing to compromise with a plan [that says] this is where we’re starting and we’re going to keep working to get to … where the vision was.”,Thakur, of Florida, said many wonderful preschool teachers don’t have bachelor’s degrees currently so it shouldn’t be a requirement at the inception of a universal program. Plus, with teachers in private preschool settings often paid much less than public school counterparts, it’s not fair to require the degrees, she said.,The idea behind universal preschool is to serve every child whose parents want a spot, but that can be hard to deliver on a consistent statewide basis.,Carlson said offering preschool in both public and private settings helps ensure access in Vermont, partly because private centers can often provide wraparound care that meshes with parents’ work schedules and locations. At the same time, some preschoolers with disabilities lose out on special education services if they attend preschool with private providers outside of their school districts, she said.,The goal should be to “put children and families at the center,” she said. “Then don’t let paperwork or artificial boundaries” get in the way.,Joe Dorman, CEO at the Oklahoma Institute for Child Advocacy, said reaching rural children has been a struggle in his state. In some cases, it’s because of preschool staff shortages or a dearth of seats, but there are also some families who don’t see the value of preschool, he said.,“This has been one of our crown jewels,” he said. “It amazes me that people won’t take the time to look at the benefits and see the good that can come from it.”,Dorman said Colorado should educate parents about the free preschool program before children turn 4.,“Begin the promotional process early,” he said. “Ensure that families recognize this.”,In some universal preschool states, school districts are in charge of overseeing the program locally and offer many preschool seats in public school classrooms. These factors make school districts a key player in the universal preschool discussion, but also raise questions about how close the association should be.,Experts from other states said it’s important that universal preschool be designed around the developmental needs of young children.,Thakur said Colorado leaders should be careful “not to bring the rigor of the K-12 system down into preschool.”,“You’ve really got to focus on relationships, making sure children learn how to communicate, cooperate, listen, and follow routines,” she said. “Those are the kinds of things that are a real down payment for the kindergarten teacher.”,Colorado’s existing preschool program is administered by school districts and 77% of students attend the program in public school classrooms, but planned changes could shake up public schools’ role in universal preschool.,Graue agreed that preschool should be developmentally appropriate, not narrowly focused on math and literacy, but also noted the downsides of divorcing preschool and K-12 policy.,During a statewide class size reduction effort in Wisconsin, for example, Graue said kindergarten classes went down to 15 children, but preschool classes in the same buildings were often much larger because they weren’t included in the state initiative.,In addition, although Wisconsin’s state-funded preschool classrooms in private settings must adhere to class size caps mandated by state child care regulations, public schools aren’t subject to those limits. Instead, each district establishes its own preschool class size rules.,“That’s the problem of the 4K [Wisconsin preschool] program working in this liminal space between K-12 and the child care system,” Graue said.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/these-four-states-already-have-universal-preschool-what-can-colorado-learn-from-them/,2022-04-30
John LaConte,"CORE Act finally makes it to U.S. Senate, but doesn’t pass committee","The CORE Act received its first committee vote before the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, a moment Sen. John Hickenlooper described as a high watermark for the long-debated bill.,The CORE Act, which stands for Colorado Outdoor Recreation & Economy, aims to protect roughly 400,000 acres of public lands in Colorado — adding 20,196 acres to the nearby Eagles Nest, Ptarmigan Peak, and Holy Cross wilderness areas — and also creates new wildlife conservation areas and a first-ever National Historic Landscape designation for Camp Hale. It has passed the U.S. House of Representatives four times.,The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources contains 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans, so there are few surprised when committee votes result in a tie.,Such was the fate of the CORE Act on Tuesday — but that doesn’t necessarily mean the legislation won’t receive a vote in the full Senate.,The tie vote Tuesday allows Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to file a discharge motion which, if approved, would absolve the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of its duty to recommend the bill for a vote of the full Senate. It can then be placed on the Senate’s executive calendar, which would allow the Senate to proceed with consideration of the bill for a final vote.,“This is a high watermark for what we hope is the final hurdle before it passes and becomes law,” Hickenlooper said of the CORE Act in his opening remarks Tuesday.,Republicans were steadfast in their disapproval of the CORE Act’s creation of areas where new mining and mineral leases won’t be issued on federal lands.,“We need to increase American development of energy and critical minerals,” said Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming. “Now isn’t the time to be permanently withdrawing federal land.”,Roughly 200,000 acres in the Thompson Divide area, which the CORE Act seeks to protect approximately from the impacts of new oil and gas leasing, was debated separately in a proposed amendment to the CORE Act, which would exclude the Thompson Divide provisions from the bill.,Sen. Mike Lee of Utah referenced a recent quote from President Biden in offering the amendment, in which , to limit the effect on gas prices in the U.S. caused by sanctions against Russia.,“Back in 2014, the Forest Service estimated that this area still has a high occurrence of oil and gas resources with a high potential for continued development and production,” Lee said. “In the words of the president, we should be using every tool in the toolbox to boost domestic production, and not stifle it.”,Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico said his state is the No. 2 producer of oil and gas in the nation.,“I wish I could say that as we have increased our production that some of the savings would find their way to the gas pump. They have not,” Heinrich said.,Hickenlooper reminded his colleagues that he spent a number of years working in the oil and gas industry. The Thompson Divide area “has some natural gas, but the cost of exploring and putting in a pipeline would never justify production,” Hickenlooper said. “There’s just not enough production that would come out of it. We also respect existing drilling rights, so the currently held leases would be protected, if someone wanted to drill on those leases, they remain effective and intact.”,The amendment received a 10-10 vote on party lines and was not added to the CORE Act.,In an ironic twist, the bill’s celebration of the WWII training ground at Camp Hale — , — was listed as a reason for Republicans in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to deny support.,“I understand the importance of historic preservation by Congress, but Congress has never designated or even debated this idea, this concept, this definition, of a National Historic Landscape,” Barrasso said. “And for this reason I oppose the bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same.”,Hickenlooper said the locally driven nature of the bill creates a model for how federal land designations should be made in the future.,Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, agreed with Hickenlooper in the approach to seeking a locally drafted public lands bill, and said despite voting against the bill, she hopes to see it pass it in the future.,“My hope is that we will eventually be able to get this one and perhaps several of the others across the line,” she said.,Sen. Angus King, a Democrat from Maine, said he was perplexed by Murkowski and other Republicans’ rejection of the CORE Act.,“I thought one of the core principles of your side was local control, respecting and listening to local voices,” King said.,Murkowski said it could be “a function of the time we’re in right now,” referencing the war in Ukraine.,“Everybody in Europe is looking to this country saying ‘how can you help us from a resource perspective?’ Whether it’s natural gas or whatever our resources might be, because we are a resource-rich state,” she said. “And so when they see that there are efforts at the administrative level to take off the table rather than to be a more broader global friend and ally in this, I think that that is part of the discussion. We’re trying to figure out where is this balance here.”,Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said Hickenlooper and Sen. Michael Bennet deserve a lot of credit for the widespread support the CORE Act has received.,“To get agreement from both the citizens and the industry — they both agreed — is an accomplishment you should be proud of, so hopefully we’ll keep working to get a positive reaction here,” Manchin said.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/core-act-finally-makes-it-to-u-s-senate-but-doesnt-pass-committee/,2022-05-04
None,Colorado’s stream management planning watered down by agriculture,"Among the goals of Colorado’s 2015 Water Plan was to focus more attention on “non-consumptive” water uses — environmental and recreation water needs — through stream management planning.,The basic idea of a stream management plan, or SMP, according to the Colorado Water Conservation Board, is when stakeholders convene to evaluate the ecological conditions of their local river to identify flow needs to support environmental and recreational water uses.,The goal was to turn some attention on non-consumptive water needs and try to address the gap between how much water is in the stream and how much is needed for a healthy environment and a good recreational experience.,“The environment and recreation are too critical to Colorado’s brand not to have robust objectives; a strong Colorado environment is critical to the economy and way of life,” reads the Water Plan, referring to the need for SMPs. The Water Plan’s objective was to cover 80% of locally prioritized rivers with an SMP by 2030.,But according to a recent River Network report on the 26 SMPs completed or in progress statewide as of September 2021, in some cases the process seems to have been taken over by agricultural interests, watering down what was supposed to have been a tool specifically for the benefit of non-consumptive water uses.,“A pillar of CWCB’s grant guidance for stream management planning is to ‘identify flows needed to support environmental and recreational water uses,’” the report reads. “This pursuit — as a primary SMP focus — has not been consistent and has proven problematic and even unpopular among participating stakeholders.”,Most SMPs evaluate flow regimes, but don’t make recommendations for a specific target flow. Of all the 269 project recommendations, just 6% focused on environmental flow targets and only 1% focused on recreation flow targets. In contrast, 14% of recommendations involved agriculture diversion reconstructions, the largest percentage of recommendations.,And although there are many recommendations for projects like stream restoration (11%) and recreation enhancements (7%), putting a number on how much water a stream needs for environmental or recreation purposes is rare. Projects tend to focus on physical modifications to the stream channel and not necessarily how to get more water into that stream channel.,“This was something I was afraid was going to happen,” said Ken Neubecker, retired Colorado projects director for American Rivers and former Colorado Basin Roundtable member. “I am a little disappointed. Yes, you’ve got to have the other stakeholders engaged, but the original intent with stream management planning was that it should primarily be addressing the environment and recreation needs of a certain stream reach.”,Nicole Seltzer is the Colorado River basin program director with River Network, the organization that produced the report and which works to protect and restore rivers. She said there are multiple factors as to why more environmental flow recommendations haven’t yet come out of the SMP process, including a lack of stream gauge data on some tributaries. But a main reason is because it’s a sensitive topic that has to be navigated carefully.,“Sometimes you have to let go of the conversations that are super divisive in order to keep your group together and keep making progress on other things,” Seltzer said. “I think that we’ve seen that the conversation around environmental flow goals and how you meet those goals is sensitive and it has the ability sometimes to derail the entire process.”,That divisiveness reveals the tension between traditional water users like agricultural producers, who take water out of the rivers, and recreational and environmental water advocates, whose goal is to keep water in the river. Environmental and recreation groups have historically not played as big a role in water planning as agricultural and municipal water managers. The SMP process was supposed to be a way to legitimize and enhance their role.,But because agriculture controls the oldest water rights and makes up the largest slice of water use in Colorado — 86% according to numbers provided by the state — some SMP stakeholder groups realized they couldn’t make progress without including agriculture representatives.,“Our organization very quickly realized if you’re going to get anywhere environmentally, you don’t just want to operate in a vacuum,” said Richard Van Gytenbeek, Colorado River basin outreach coordinator for environmental group Trout Unlimited, and a Colorado Basin Roundtable member. “You’ve got to bring your municipal and agriculture folks to the table.”,In some cases, what started out as an SMP morphed into an IWMP — Integrated Water Management Plans — so named because they integrate the “non-consumptive” environmental and recreation water uses and the “consumptive” agricultural uses.,The Colorado Basin Roundtable adopted the term IWMP in place of SMP in 2016 and defined the primary goal of an IWMP as “identifying opportunities to meet environmental flow needs along with needs of agriculture, municipal, industrial and residential water users.” The roundtable’s choice to use the term IWMP was in response to concerns that stream management planning could emphasize environmental and recreational water needs in a way that might negatively impact agricultural water users and other interests.,The IWMP undertaken by the Middle Colorado Watershed Council was one of these that started out as an SMP and then expanded the scope to incorporate agricultural interests. The Book Cliff, South Side and Mount Sopris conservation districts tackled the agriculture portion, which included an agricultural water use analysis and inventories of 59 ditches. The individual results of the ditch inventories were not made publicly available, despite being publicly funded.,The final action plan outlines 55 recommendations, including six which it says address protection of flows. These include doing a survey of boaters and anglers to see what their flow preferences are, installing more stream gauges on local tributaries of the Colorado River and supporting the Colorado River District as they work to keep water on the Western Slope.,The idea was that a watershed council, environmental group or other organization would come up with a way to prioritize local streams and get to work creating SMPs for 80% of the ones they deem to be high priority. But since there was no standardized way to do this across the state, streams in areas with environmentally focused watershed organizations tend to have SMPs, while those without them don’t.,Many of the projects recommended in the SMPs are “multi-beneficial,” meaning they benefit multiple water user groups: agriculture, environment, recreation, municipal, industrial. Checking more category boxes for a project can sometimes aid in getting grant funding.,Often, the thinking around a diversion reconstruction or other improvements to irrigation infrastructure is that it can help irrigators more effectively get water out of the river. At the same time, a project could also create a safer passage for boaters or better fish habitat. But these multi-beneficial projects can also have a downside.,“There is an argument that focusing on multibenefit projects that primarily benefit water users dilutes environmental and recreational flow objectives,” the River Network report reads.,And the tools for boosting river flows are few. While some SMPs are motivated by needing to meet federal requirements, for example keeping enough water in the chronically dry 15-mile reach of the Colorado River in the Grand Valley for the benefit of endangered fish, this is not common, according to the report.,“In most communities, the only options for pursuing flow-driven outcomes are expensive infrastructure (e.g. ditch piping) or tools for leaving excess water in the river (e.g. water leasing),” the report reads.,The idea is that when irrigators have more efficient diversions, they don’t need to take as much water from the river, leaving more for the benefit of the environment and recreation. But whether that actually happens or not is unclear.,CWCB Watershed Protection Director Chris Sturm said that addressing flow needs is not the only metric of success for an SMP or a project. If a project results in any kind of physical benefit to the stream, it can be considered a win. He said by and large the SMPs are accomplishing what they set out to do.,“Stream management planning is not all about identifying what the flow needs are,” Sturm said. “I think what our stakeholders are doing is they are finding a path towards trusting each other enough to get to those discussions about flow needs. And it’s being done in a way where they are partnering on projects like diversion reconstructions, which is why you see so many of them.”,Although low flow is not the only issue for the environment and recreation communities, it is often the biggest; other problems like high water temperatures are partly a result of there not being enough water in the river.,“I would say recreation in Colorado is more threatened by diminishing streamflow,” said Hattie Johnson, southern Rockies stewardship director with American Whitewater. “You can fix the navigation hazard, but if there’s no water in the river to float down it, it doesn’t matter. I think the flow aspect of it is much more dire.”,Raymond Langstaff is the president of the Bookcliff Conservation District, which extends roughly between Glenwood Springs and Parachute, mostly on the north side of Interstate 70. His organization, along with the Mount Sopris and South Side conservation districts, led the agriculture portion of the IWMP process for the Middle Colorado region.,“One of the reasons we got involved is because we have a target on our back for water,” Langstaff said. “The bottom line is ag has the bulk of the water. When people need water, where are they going to go? They are going to go to ag to get the water.”,And agricultural water users are feeling the squeeze from drought and climate change too. Langstaff, a retired engineer with the U.S. Forest Service, has a place on Dry Rifle Creek that has been in his family since 1951. He irrigates about 22 acres of grass and alfalfa with water from the Grass Valley Canal and sells the bales of hay to horse owners.,This year, the number of days he is allowed to use water from the local irrigation water project dropped from 50 to 35 this year. If the water gets cut more, he may do one fewer cutting of hay. And irrigators on the south side of the Colorado River have it even worse.,“If you live on Divide Creek, chances are you will be out of water somewhere around the Fourth of July,” he said.,One of the ideas behind the ditch inventory, in which irrigators got an analysis of their system and potential areas of improvement, was that they would result in efficiency projects that would benefit the irrigator and could also leave more water in streams for the benefit of the environment.,But Langstaff is skeptical that agriculture projects will automatically lead to more water in streams. If agricultural producers can more easily get access to their full water right by making efficiency improvements, they will probably take advantage of that by using all of their water, he said.,“It’s a false hope they might be able to free up a little more water to leave in the river,” Langstaff said. “If you get more efficient, you get to water more times. And it’s their water and they have the right to use it.”,The results of a 2019 survey about SMPs by the Colorado Cattlemen’s Ag Water Network seems to confirm that sentiment. More than half of respondents said the amount of water available to them was a challenge. Survey responses also indicated that more acres would be irrigated and more acres would be more fully irrigated if more water was available for diversion.,If environmental and recreation groups want more water to stay in the river, it will require paying agricultural water users, Langstaff said.,“If you want ag to let water stay in the stream, you’re going to have to compensate somehow,” he said. “If you’re in the ag business exclusively, you need every nickel and dime.”,The actions of diverters often have the biggest influence on the health of rivers and the quantity of water in them. And as the flows of the Colorado River and its tributaries continue to decline due to climate change, there will be even less water to go around.,In the hierarchy of water uses in Colorado, environmental and recreation interests have taken a back seat to traditional water uses like agriculture. Under the bedrock principle of Colorado water law, prior appropriation, the oldest water rights — typically agricultural water rights — get first use of the river.,The only way to secure a water right specifically for the environment is through an instream flow right, which is held exclusively by the CWCB to “preserve the natural environment to a reasonable degree.” Although the state has ISF rights on nearly 1,700 stream segments around Colorado, they date to the 1970s and later, making them very junior to most agricultural and municipal water rights, and thus limiting their ability to keep water in the stream.,As for recreation, a handful of communities around the state hold what’s known as a recreational in-channel diversion, or RICD, around which they have built a whitewater park or play waves primarily for kayakers. But in a nod to traditional water users, these rights often end up making concessions to future water development. Two bills floated by recreation proponents that aimed to secure water for recreation purposes have stalled in 2021 and 2022.,But most environmental and recreation groups still say that cooperation among all water users within the existing constraints is the best way forward and insist they are making inroads.,“If you’re an environmental advocate you do the best operating in the system that exists, and the system that exists is Colorado water law,” Van Gytenbeek said. “You have to work with water rights holders to see if there’s flexibility in their operations. It’s not a perfect world and it can be very frustrating if you are a kayaker or a fisherman. But we are making progress by collaborating.”",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/colorados-stream-management-planning-watered-down-by-agriculture/,2022-05-07
None,Moose calves found dead in Silverthorne prompts investigation,"Two moose calves were found dead in Silverthorne last month, and a toxicologist says they were poisoned by yew trees.,Colorado Parks and Wildlife confirmed that necropsy results showed that the two calves consumed parts of a yew plant before dying in a yard in the Eagle’s Nest neighborhood in Silverthorne. Yew plants are highly poisonous to humans, wildlife, horses, cattle, sheep, goats and dogs because of the alkaloid taxine.,Jake Kay, wildlife district manager for Parks and Wildlife, was called to Silverthorne about the calves, and he initially said he was not entirely sure how the calves had died. They were thin, but that is common for wildlife toward the end of winter — when fat reserves are low and greenery has not completely grown back yet.,Kay said it looked as if they had just dropped dead from where they had been standing.,“They were in a little shady spot under some trees and there was a fair bit of snow,” he said. “There were moose tracks walking in, but it didn’t appear the moose were running or anything like that. There were some scavenger dog tracks, like domestic dogs, but there were no signs of mountain lions, no bears — nothing that would indicate predation. It kind of looked like these two moose just sat down and died.”,Because of the circumstances, Kay said that he performed a necropsy in the field and found no trauma or bullet holes. Their organs also looked normal, as well.,“There was really nothing abnormal that we found,” Kay said. “In addition, their stomachs were full of food that formed fecal pellets. Sometimes when they’re sick, they’ll have diarrhea or if they’re really sick, they can’t even move. They won’t have food in their stomachs because they’re not out and about eating. They also didn’t have any ticks or anything like that — no parasites on the outside, as well.”,At this point, Kay said that he suspected toxicity and consulted a wildlife pathologist, who suspected yew plants. After looking into what yew leaves looked like, he went to see what he could find.,“I went back through the stomach contents of the moose and found what to me looked like the yew images,” he said.,Stomach samples from each calf were sent to a lab, where it was determined to be yew.,According to Colorado State University’s ,, the highest concentration of taxine in yew plants is generally found in the leaves in wintertime. Adult cattle and horses have been fatally poisoned with as little as 8-16 ounces of yew leaves.,Yews are evergreen shrubs or small trees with glossy, rigid, dark green leaves up to 2 inches long with pointed ends, and they are closely spaced on the branches. Western yew and American yew are two indigenous species. English yew and Japanese yew are not indigenous but are commonly cultivated species in North America and are sometimes used in landscaping.,A , detailing the event grew popular online, garnering over 800 reactions and over 100 comments within the first day of being posted. The post includes a photo of a deceased moose calf.,Kay added that residents who use yew bushes or trees in their landscaping should be mindful of access to wildlife.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/moose-calves-found-dead-in-silverthorne-prompts-investigation/,2022-04-30
None,Half-mile avalanche shaves snow from Bald Mountain near Breckenridge,"Avalanche season isn’t over yet.,A pair of skiers triggered a domino-effect of an avalanche Tuesday at Bald Mountain east of Breckenridge, estimated at half a mile wide and up to 10 feet deep, according to Colorado Avalanche Information Center officials.,An avalanche in wind-tossed snow unsettled two lower layers of snow, one after the other, resulting in a major avalanche. No one was caught or hurt by it.,According to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center’s report, the first skier triggered a 50-foot-wide windslab. The skier escaped to a predetermined safe zone. The windslab, in turn, triggered another slab 3 to 4 feet deep below.,When those slabs neared the bottom of the chute, the entire left side of the chute broke, sending a third slab of snow sliding to the bottom.,The two skiers estimated the fallen slabs to be as tall as 10 feet in some spots based on the crown left behind, which spanned nearly a half-mile.,The run was the skiers’ second of the day on Bald Mountain. They previously skied a more easterly face.,“We very much underestimated the potential for deep slab avalanches today,” the skiers wrote in the Colorado Avalanche Information Center report. “Our biggest takeaway was that this snowpack is nowhere near stable in a lot more places than one might expect.”,Colorado Avalanche Information Center director Ethan Greene called the event “uncommon.”,The two lower layers of snowpack had been mostly stable, Greene said. The Colorado Avalanche Information Center saw little activity in them across the region and considered them dormant, making the avalanche somewhat unusual.,Anna DeBattiste of Summit County Rescue Group said the two skiers reported the avalanche immediately after it was triggered, providing some colorful words in their description.,Expletives aside, DeBattiste they want to encourage people to make reports of any avalanches they witness because it can relieve response teams, many of which are all-volunteer groups.,Storms last weekend dropped over a foot of snow in the Breckenridge area. High winds moving south and west carried snow up and over ridges and deposited snow on north-, northeast- and east-facing slopes according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center report.,Such winds will scour ridges, create cornices and deposit pillows of snow along slopes.  Greene and the Colorado Avalanche Information Center encourage backcountry travelers to avoid wind loaded features like cornices and pillows.,Likewise, Greene encourages anyone heading into avalanche territory to do so early in the day this time of year.,“The adage is: start early, end early,” he said.,With spring’s warm days and cold nights, it’s safest to venture out in the morning. Snow will soften as the sun and temperatures rise, and avalanche risk will increase as the day progresses. That soft snow will freeze again during the night, gluing the snowpack together and tending to remain firm through the morning, officials said.,While Summit County’s avalanche risk was assessed as low, as Friday evening, officials say this does not mean avalanches are impossible. The local forecast says the highest risk of avalanches will be on northeast-, north- and northwest-facing slopes, near and above treeline.,A storm is expected to impact the Rocky Mountains this weekend and deposit up to 8 inches at high elevations. Strong northwesterly winds are expected to accompany the snow, drifting into slabs that could crack and break beneath or above skiers, the avalanche center reports.,Any avalanches that do occur are forecasted to be “large” to “very large,” according to avalanche officials, much like the Bald Mountain slide this week.,In the 2021-22 season so far, Colorado Avalanche Information Center has reported almost 5,000 avalanches. Greene considered that normal, although he clarified not all avalanches are reported.,Deaths are the only exact count the center records. There have been six deaths from avalanches this season, down from last year’s 12. The 10-year Colorado average is six per season.,Witnesses can report an avalanche by calling non-emergency dispatch at 970-668-8600.,Backcountry travelers can check the Colorado avalanche forecast , at Avalanche.state.co.us/forecasts., ",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/half-mile-avalanche-shaves-snow-from-bald-mountain-near-breckenridge/,2022-04-30

The corrals are about 300 yards apart from each other.,The BLM is working with Colorado State University and the University of California Davis to identify the illness. Ginger Fedak, director of the Wild Horse and Burro Program for the group In Defense of Animals, noted those are two of the best veterinary schools in the country.,“This is spreading so rapidly and it’s so lethal,” Fedak said. “That’s what the mystery is — what could this be?”,The illness doesn’t seem like it could be strangles — a malady similar to strep throat in humans — because, while it can be lethal, strangles wouldn’t be killing this many horses, Fedak said.,Despite the change in horses used for the makeover, Macnab said she hasn’t had any of the trainers back out.,Macnab doesn’t know where all the horses are coming from at this point, but she said she is excited for the event.,“It’s a bit like going on a blind date,” Macnab said. “It’s going to be just as exciting as getting a Sand Wash horse because we have no idea, until they drop those horses off, what they’re going to look like.”",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/sand-wash-basin-horses-wont-be-used-at-mustang-makeover-amid-outbreak-of-unknown-illness/,2022-04-29
None,Colorado Parks & Wildlife director suspended after alleged “back of the bus” comment about Black employee,"The Colorado Department of Natural Resources placed Parks and Wildlife Director Dan Prenzlow on paid leave after a Black employee sent an open letter to Gov. Jared Polis complaining of racism against her and others at a Vail outdoors conference.,The letter by the employee, statewide partnerships coordinator Alease “Aloe” Lee, said Prenzlow tried to thank her for helping organize the sold-out Partners in the Outdoors Conference held at Vail’s The Hythe hotel on Apr. 19. As she stood in the back of the room, Lee said, “In a failed attempt to thank me, he exclaims on stage in front of 600 people ‘… there she is! In the back of the bus, Aloe!’”,Before the civil rights movement of the 1960s, many American cities had Jim Crow laws and practices that required Black passengers, for example, to give up their bus seats to white passengers and take seats at the back. Civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks famously refused in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955.,Lee’s letter to Polis and the DNR leadership said Prenzlow sought her out later and said “he wasn’t aware of the context of his words and that he didn’t mean any harm. I have never known the phrase ‘back of the bus’ to not cause harm to Black people.”,Lee is the organizer of the annual Partners in the Outdoors Conference, which gathers hundreds of local governments, businesses, conservation groups and advocacy organizations to discuss potential ways diverse groups can work together on natural resource protection. The one-day event featured several breakout sessions, a keynote luncheon and awards dinner.

None,Colorado officials warn 2022 could be worst wildfire year in state history,"Colorado will pour an additional $20 million in federal funding into firefighting and prevention initiatives ahead of what officials say could be the worst wildfire season in the state’s history.,Above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation are predicted across the state through June, thrusting many parts of Colorado into more severe drought conditions and placing more of the state at risk, officials said during a presentation Friday on this year’s wildfire outlook.,Monsoonal moisture could bring reprieve to the Western Slope in June, but current forecasts predict extreme drought conditions for the Front Range through July, Mike Morgan, director of Colorado’s Division of Fire Prevention and Control said.,Ahead of what could be a devastating wildfire season, Colorado’s strategy to fight fires involves early detection and aggressive initial attack, Morgan said. The funding will help the state grow its firefighting fleet for the 2022 wildfire season and implement a statewide dispatch center.,Last year, 6,679 reported fires burned a total of 56,056 acres — marking an uptick from the average 5,507 fires reported per year in Colorado, Morgan said.,The state is expected to experience up to a fivefold increase in acres burned by wildfires by 2050, according to the Division of Fire Prevention and Control’s 2022 Wildfire Preparedness Plan.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/colorado-officials-warn-2022-could-be-worst-wildfire-year-in-state-history/,2022-04-24
None,State lawmakers suspend attempt at legislative fix for water speculation,"Colorado lawmakers have suspended an attempt to prohibit outside investors from profiting off the state’s water.,On Thursday, the Senate Agriculture & Natural Resources Committee voted 5-2 to approve an amendment sending Senate Bill 29 back to the interim Water Resources Review Committee for more study and input from water users. However, at the end of Thursday’s hearing, Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg, acting as chair, decided to “lay over” the bill, meaning the committee would take it up at another time.,But with the 2022 legislative session ending May 11, there is probably neither time nor the desire from lawmakers to push the bill through, meaning that, to all appearances, the legislation is dead. The Senate Agriculture & Natural Resources Committee would now have to take the measure back up and move it along to the full Senate and then to the House in order for it to go back to the interim committee.,Sonnenberg, R-Sterling, and Sen. Kerry Donovan, D-Eagle County, who initially proposed the back-to-interim-committee amendment and is a sponsor of the bill, were the two votes against sending the issue back to the interim committee. It’s unclear why Donovan, who did not return a call for clarification as of press time, voted against her own amendment.,“We gave it a heck of a college try,” said Donovan, the twice-elected representative for Senate District 5, which includes Pitkin County, who will be stepping down at the end of the year due to term limits. “And I think we continued an important conversation. Water always takes a long time to figure out and I was certainly hopeful that by having a bill we would force conversation.”,Senate Bill 29, with Western Slope sponsors Donovan and Sen. Don Coram, R-Montrose, was an attempt to stop out-of-state investors in agricultural water from making a profit off a public resource that grows scarcer in a water-short future driven by climate change.,Many say investment water speculation is a threat, but few agree on what should be done about it. A legislative fix, despite several attempts at tweaks with amendments throughout the session, failed to gain support from the constituency the bill aimed to protect: agricultural water users. Although some agricultural water rights holders recognize there could be negative impacts to their communities if water is sold to investors, they don’t want the state making the process of selling their ranch harder, placing restrictions on who they can sell to or limiting their ability to make a profit.,The original bill would have given the state engineer at the Department of Water Resources the ability to investigate complaints of investment water speculation and fine a purchaser of water rights up to $10,000 if they determine speculation is occurring.,That version failed to gain traction, as did a handful of proposed “strike-below” or “strike-through” amendments, including one put forth by the Colorado River Water Conservation District, which would have addressed speculation using the abandonment principle by saying that if someone was getting paid to not use their water, they could be punished by losing their water right.,Donovan then floated the most recent amendment that would have sent the issue back to the interim Water Resources Committee for further study and input from water users, a move Coram said was kicking the can down the road.,Lawmakers scolded some in the water community for what they said was a lack of cooperation and communication around developing legislation aimed at preventing speculation.,“We have an ineffective water group that won’t have a conversation with lawmakers anymore,” Sonnenberg said. “When we have a bill they just take a position and quit working with people.”,At Thursday’s hearing, several people testified in opposition to the bill. Colorado Water Congress, Colorado Farm Bureau, Rocky Mountain Farmers Union, as well as three Grand Valley water providers, among others, were opposed to the bill.,Former state representative from Gunnison County Kathleen Curry works as a lobbyist on behalf of the Orchard Mesa Irrigation District, Grand Valley Water Users Association and the Ute Water Conservancy District, organizations that provide agricultural and domestic water to the Grand Valley. She said her clients would support taking more time to consult with experts and stakeholders.,“My folks have two major concerns regarding the legislation as it was introduced and as it’s been contemplated so far,” she said. “One has to do with the additional time needed to obtain feedback from the affected parties and water rights owners, and secondly, they are still a bit unclear about the need for legislation, and the scope of potential impacts to water rights owners remains a concern.”,The Grand Valley has been the center of investment water speculation concerns, where New York City-based private-equity firm Water Asset Management has been acquiring irrigated farmland. WAM is now the largest landowner in the Grand Valley Water Users Association. But as long as WAM keeps putting the water to beneficial use and keeps the land in agricultural production — which it appears to be doing — it doesn’t count as speculation.,Still, the threat from out-of-state, urban interests loomed large at Thursday’s hearing.,“We were hearing across our districts and state about a new type of player in the water world,” Donovan said. “And that player was custom suits and shiny shoes that call big cities home. … There was concern from many in the water world that probably an investment firm was not going to be the best partner moving forward.”,In an attempt to address the issue in 2020, legislators convened a workgroup, made up of water managers and policy experts across sectors to explore ways to strengthen the state’s anti-speculation laws. Saddled with the incredibly complex task of figuring out how to protect Colorado’s water from profit-seeking investors without infringing on private property rights, an August 2021 report from the workgroup did not give recommendations to lawmakers because they could not come to a consensus about which concepts to implement. The group’s report did, however, lay out potential avenues new regulations to prevent investment water speculation could take.,For Loma rancher, workgroup member and president of GVWUA Joe Bernal, the lack of consensus meant that lawmakers should not move forward with any legislation.,“Our group found it very important that more information be gathered from landowners and stakeholders,” he told the committee Thursday. “I find it very concerning that bill sponsors moved forward with the crafting of an anti-speculation bill when there seems to be very little support from the people and the citizens it seems the sponsors are trying to protect.”,The concern at the heart of the speculation issue is not that investors could profit off of Colorado’s water. Underneath, there is a broader fear about the loss of agricultural land and with it, a way of life and a part of Colorado’s history, culture and identity. The work group identified the large-scale, permanent dry-up of agricultural lands as the No. 1 risk from speculators.,For Bernal, the bigger threat to Colorado agriculture comes from developers who would subdivide the land for houses and ranchettes and take it out of agricultural production. The acres that were sold to WAM, which are still being farmed, could have been sold instead to developers, an outcome he doesn’t want to see.,“I think it could be studied further, but at this point we don’t have a problem yet,” Bernal said. “I’m not saying I’m glad WAM is here, but it seems to be the lesser of two evils. Given the choice of having the land developed, it’s a better option.”",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/state-lawmakers-suspend-attempt-at-legislative-fix-for-water-speculation/,2022-04-23
Nate Peterson,Vail Resorts reports skier visits up 12.5% from last season,"A substantial jump in pre-purchased pass sales leading up to the current season fueled a double-digit gain in skier visits, Vail Resorts reported Monday.,In a company release, the resort operator said total skier visits were up 12.5% compared to last season through April 17, 2022. The reported ski season metrics are for Vail Resorts’ North American destination mountain resorts and regional ski areas, and exclude metrics from the recently acquired Seven Springs Resorts in Pennsylvania and the company’s Australian ski areas.,Vail Resorts also reported that season-to-date total lift ticket revenue, including an allocated portion of season pass revenue for each applicable period, was up 19.4% compared to the prior year. Ski school revenue was also up 53%, dining revenue was up 73.2%, and retail/rental revenue for North American resort and ski area store locations was up 39% compared to the prior year.,“This year, challenging early season conditions persisted through the holiday period, but our results were strong from January through the remainder of the season,” said CEO Kirsten Lynch. “Our strong season pass sales heading into the season, which are the foundation of our advance commitment strategy, resulted in particularly strong destination visitation and were further supported by lift ticket sales at our Colorado and Utah resorts that exceeded our expectations.”,The average U.S. ski area was open for 112 days in 2020-21, up from 99 days in the shortened 2019-20 season. And in 2021-22, many Vail Resorts properties experienced even longer seasons than in 2020-21, with Vail Mountain boasting its longest season on record.,Vail Resorts also required reservations to access its mountains in 2020-21, one of several significant impacts to visitation not experienced in 2021-22.,Despite the COVID-19 impacts, however, the 2020-21 season was the ,, according to the National Ski Areas Association.,Skier visits to U.S. resorts totaled 59 million for the 2020-21 season, with 78% of ski area operators saying the 2020-21 season exceeded their expectations.,The National Ski Areas Association is expected to release 2021-22 season stats in June.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/vail-resorts-reports-skier-visits-up-12-5-from-last-season/,2022-04-26
None,"Colorado homelessness bills would bring more funding, resources","Several bills introduced to Colorado’s House of Representatives and Senate on Monday would bring more local funds to address homelessness around the state if they are passed.,The four bills were introduced Monday after a news conference with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis. At the conference, Polis said the bills address the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.,“Vulnerable individuals and families who are on the brink have been more likely to fall into homelessness, and it has become even harder for people who are already experiencing homelessness to access the services that they need to break the cycle,” Polis said.,The new bills aim to support local governments and nonprofits in their efforts to help people in those situations.,The bill that is most likely to enact local change is House Bill 1377, which would establish a grant for local governments and nonprofits to spend on homelessness resources, said State Rep. Julie McCluskie, D-Dillon, who represents District 61, including Pitkin County.,If passed, the state would allocate $105 million from its federal COVID-19 recovery funds to the grant program, which would support a wide array of homelessness services.,Local governments and nonprofits would be able to use the funds to support programs that convert existing properties into transitional housing with wraparound services. They could also invest the money into data collection, fund housing development projects, build homeless shelters and connect homeless people to services throughout the state.,Another bill, H.B. 1083, would expand an income tax credit program that supports homelessness projects. The goal of the program is to incentivize support for homelessness services, especially in underserved rural areas.,The bill would also expand the tax credit program so that people could receive credits for donating to nonprofits that provide homelessness services.,The other bills would provide targeted efforts to improve housing in the Denver area, but that doesn’t mean they’re not relevant to mountain communities, McCluskie said.,H.B. 1378 and S.B. 211 would both establish government-funded homeless centers in the Denver area. The bill in the House of Representatives would make the state create a grant program for a local government in the Denver metropolitan area to build a regional navigation campus dedicated to the prevention of homelessness.,The state would set aside $50 million to build the campus, which would provide mental health, transitional housing, permanent housing, emergency shelter, addiction recovery and case management services.,The bill in the Senate would transition the Ridge View Youth Services Center in Watkins into the Ridge View Supportive Residential Community, which would provide housing, behavioral health treatment, medical care, job training and skill development for residents.,McCluskie said the two Denver-based programs may free up state funds that could be diverted to support initiatives around the state.,“Not only do we learn from some of those investments and improvements in the state, but it can also take pressure off that limited pool of resources,” she said.,The homelessness bills have only been introduced into the House and Senate and would need approval from both governing bodies before receiving a final signoff from Polis.,McCluskie said the bills, as well as other efforts to improve housing, have received largely bipartisan support.,“In a time when so many political issues become divisive, I think it’s been really powerful to see Republicans and Democrats come together and work on these problems,” she said.",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/colorado-homelessness-bills-would-bring-more-funding-resources/,2022-04-21
John LaConte,Pennies on the dollar: Effort to opt out of Vail Resorts settlement being organized,"By now, approximately 100,000 Vail Resorts employees and former employees have likely received “an email, two text messages, and a large envelope by mail from nine attorneys,” writes the creator of ,.,The site’s creator, allegedly an hourly employee from a Vail resort in California who otherwise wishes to remain anonymous, has a message for anyone who received the envelope, which contains a settlement offer from Vail Resorts.,“These attorneys urge you to opt-in to the settlement that they negotiated in the class action lawsuit Hamilton v. Vail … What happens when you opt-in? You get about $0.05 for every $1.00 Vail should have paid you. The attorneys get paid $4,366,666.67. And Vail laughs all the way to its next annual meeting, noting that it disposed of a potential cost of over $100,000,000 for $13,100,000,” the letter on the site’s homepage states., launched on Sunday and is meant to let Vail Resorts employees know they have the option not to take the “pennies on the dollar” offer being made to them on ,, a website set up by the attorneys who have negotiated the settlement in Hamilton v. Vail.,“Even if only a few thousand of us opt-out, Vail will get the message,” ,states.,The writer allegedly received an offer of less than $100 on an estimated $2,000 in unpaid wages alleged by the plaintiffs attorneys,,“It is not fair for us to get 7.2% of what the attorneys claimed we were owed while they collect millions,” , states. “They conveniently arranged for $4,366,666.67 in fees and $50,000 more in cost reimbursement for their services.”,By opting out of Hamilton v. Vail, employees retain their right to pursue legal action against Vail Resorts in other cases.,“We do not comment on settlement details, and Vail Resorts believes the settlement is appropriate and fair,” Jamie Alvarez, director of corporate communications for Vail Resorts, said in a written statement provided to the Vail Daily in early October.,One such case is Quint v. Vail, a similar effort to Hamilton v. Vail, currently being pursued in Colorado. The Hamilton v. Vail case is taking place in California but cites violations of state labor laws in 16 different states where Vail Resorts operates. In total, there are 33 different violations alleged, including failure to pay for all hours worked and failure to pay overtime wages.,“If you opt-in to this case, you cannot later join Quint v. Vail,” , states. “The settlement notice omits the fact that you may have another option if you opt-out. You might be able to join a case (Quint v. Vail) that is pending in a Federal Court in Colorado where Vail Resorts is headquartered.”,The opt-out effort could result in a dissolving of the settlement if 5% of the class opts out.,“If that happens, either these attorneys can start working for a living and negotiate a better settlement or they can drop their lawsuit,” , states. “Maybe the Colorado attorneys can do a better job for us.”",https://www.aspentimes.com/news/regional/pennies-on-the-dollar-effort-to-opt-out-of-vail-resorts-settlement-being-organized/,2022-04-19
